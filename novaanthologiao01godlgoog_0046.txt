Ο lyric love, heli-angel and heli-bird

And all e wonder end a wild desire,-

Boldeet of hecrts thet ever breved the eun,

Tock sanctuary within the holicr blue,

And sang c kindrcd soul out to his face,—

Yet human ct the red-ripe of the heort-

When the first summcne from the darkling earth
Reached thee emid thy chcmhern, blanched their blue,
And bared them cf their glory—to drop down,

To toil for men, to suffer cr to die,-— Ι

This is the seme voice: ccn thy eoul know change?
Hail then, and heerken from the reninis of help!
Never mey I commence my song, my due

Το God who beet taught song by gift cf thee,
Except with bent head end bescoching hand-

That still, despite the distance end the derk,

What wne, again moy bc: some interchange

Of grece, some splendour once thy very thought,
Some benediction anciently thy smile:

-Never conclude, but raising hand and hccd
Thither where oyen, thot cannot reech, yet yccrn
For cll hope, all sustoinment, all reward,

Their utmcst, up and on,-so bleseing back

1n thoee thy reclms of help, that heaven thy home,
Some whitenese which, I judge, thy foce makes proud,

Some wanness where, I think, thy foot may fall!
⁴ Bncwnrwo.
