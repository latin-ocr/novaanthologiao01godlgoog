ANTHOLOGIA

Forth bhrough the world they go,

Hymning to all below,

Thoe, whom the blest shall know,
Lord of the skies!

Rending tho hostile town,
Smiting the godless hosts 3
Hurling ohe demone down
To the drear coasts.
still with thy lightning frown
Winning thee wide renown,
'Pili the wild waters drown
All their proud boasts.

Menoeceus, thou hest oyen, and I ean hear

Τοο plainly what full tides of onseb sap

Our seven high getes, and what a weight of wer
Rides on those ringing axlesl jingle of bibe,
ShoubS, arrOWS, tramp of the hornfooted horse
Theb grind the glebe to powder! Sbony showers
Of that eansbunning hail of Ares erash

Along the sounding walls, Above, below,

Shoek after ebech, the song-built towers and gabes
Reel, bruised end butted with the shuddering
War·bhunder of iren-rams3 and from within

The oiby eomes a murmur void of joy,

Lesb she be taken captive-maidens, wives,

And mothers with their bobblere of the dawn,
And oldest age in ehodow from the night,
Feliing about their shrines before their Gode
And weiling ‘Save ue'
