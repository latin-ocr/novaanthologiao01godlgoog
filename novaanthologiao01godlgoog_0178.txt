Set where the upper streame of Simois flow

Was the Palladium, high 'mid rook and wood;
And Hector was in Ilium, 111 below,

And fought, and saw it not-but there it stood!
It stood, and sun and moonshine rained their light
On the pure columns of its glou-built 11111,
Baekward and forward rolled the waves of fight
Round Troy-but while this stood, Troy could not fall.
So. in its lovely moonlight, lives the soul.
Mountains surround it, and sweet virgin air;

Cold, plashing past it, crystal wetere roll;

We visit it by momente, 111, too rare!

We shall renew the battle on the plain
Tomorrowz-red with blood will Xanthus be;
Hector and Ajax will be there again,

Helen will come upon the walls to see.

Still doth the soul from its lone fastness high
Upon our life a ruling effluence send3

' And when it falls, fight as 11111111, we ‹lie3

And while it laets, we cannot wholly end.

11. ARNOLD.

These three alone lead lile to sovereign power.

Yet not for power—power of itself

Would' come uncalled for-but to live by law,
Acting the law we live by, without fear:
And because right is right, to follow right

Were wisdom, in the ecorn of consequence. ι
