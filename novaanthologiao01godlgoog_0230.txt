And on the night
When Uther in Tintagil pest away
Moening and weiling for an heir, the two
Descending thro’ the dismal night-a night
In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost-
Beheld‚ so high upon the dreary deeps
It seem’d in heaven, a ship‚ the shape thereos
Α dregon wing’d, and all from stem to ehem
Bright with a shining people on the (lecke,
And gone as soon as seen. And then the two
Droph to t-he eove, and watch’d the great sea fall,
Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,
Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep
And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged
Roaring, and all the wave was in a fleme:
And down the wave end in the fleme was borne
A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feeh‚
Who stoopt and caughb the babe, and eried ‘The King!
Here is an heir for Utherl’ And the fringe
0f that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,
Lash’d at the wizard as he spake the word.
And presently thereafter follow’d calm.
