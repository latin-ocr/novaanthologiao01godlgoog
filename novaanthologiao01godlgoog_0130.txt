And then I changed my pipings,—
Singing how down 1110 valley 01 Maenalus
I pursued a maiden and clasped a reed:
Gods and men, we all are deluded thus!
It breaks in our bosom and 111011 we bleed:
All wepl, as I ween both ye now would,
If envy or age had 1101 1101011 your blood,

At 1110 sorrow 01 my sweel pipingsl
sunum.

11011. Come, come, we fear the worst: all will be
well.
3011. When clouds are seen, wiso men pul on

their cloaks3

When greal leaves fall, 111011 winter is at hand3
When 1110 sun sels, who doth 1101 look for night?
Unlimely storms make men expeol a dearlh:

All may be well; but, 11 God eorl 11 so,

’Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.

2011. Truly 1110 hearts 01111011 are full 01 1001,
You cannol reason 01111001 wilh a man
Thai looks 1101 heavily and full 01 dread.

3011. Βο1010 the days of change, still is it so:
By a divine instinct, men’s minds mistrusl
Ensuing danger3 as, by proof, we see,

The water swell before a boist'rous storm.
