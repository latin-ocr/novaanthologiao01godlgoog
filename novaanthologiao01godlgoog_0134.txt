All 010 1101 just, because they do no wrong,
, But he, who will not wrong me when he may,

He 10 the truly just. Ipreise not them,
Who in their petty dealings pilfer not余
But him, whose conscience spurns 0 000101 1101111,

. When he might plunder end dely surprise:
His be the praise, who looking down with soorn
On the false judgement of the partiel herd,
Consulto his own clear heert, end boldly dares
'Po be, not to be thought, 011 honest 111011.

Now fades the 1001 10113 stresk of snow,
Now burgeons every maze of quiok
About the flowering squares, end thiok

By ashen 10010 the violets blow.

Now rings the woodland loud 01111 10113,
The distance takes 0 10101101 hue,
And drown'd 111 yonder living hlue

The 10111 becomes 0 sightless song.

Now danoe the lights on 101111 end 100,

The flooks 010 whiter down the 1010,
And milkier every milky sail
On winding stream or distant sea余

Where now the seamew pipes, or dives

In yonder greening 3100111, and fly

The happy birds, 11101 01101130 their sky
To build 01111 brood余 that live their lives

From land to land3 end in my breast
Spring wakens too 余 01111 my regret
Beeomes an April violet,

And buds and blossoms like the rest. 1111110011.
