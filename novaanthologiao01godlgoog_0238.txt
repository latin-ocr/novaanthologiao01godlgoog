As the sky-brightening south wind clears the day,
And makes the massed clouds roll,

The mueie of the lyre blows away

The clouds that wrap the soul.

Oh that Faie had let me see

rhet triumph of the sweeh persuasive lym!
Ther famous, final victory

When jealous Pan with Marsyas did conspire!
When, from far Parnassus’ side,

Young Apelle, all the pride

Of the Phrygien flutes to tame,

Το the Phrygisn highlends came!

Where the long green med-bede swey
In the rippled wetere grey

Of that solitary lake

Where Maeander's springs are born3
Where the ridged pins-wooded roots
Of Messogis westward break,
Mounting westwerd, high and higher.

There wee held the famous strife!
Μ. ennom.
