Thon saw they how there hove a dusky bargo,

Black ae a funeral sear-f from stem to stern,

Beneath them; and deseending they were ware

That all the deoks were dense with stately forme,
Black-stoled, blaekhooded, like a dream—by these
Three Queens with erowns of gold: and from them rose
A ery that shiver'd to the tingling staro,

And, ae it were one voice, an agony

Of lamentation‚ like a wind that shrills

All night in a waste land, where no one eomer,

Or hath eome, ainoe the making of the world.

Life! I know not what thou art;
But know that thou and I must part;

And when or how or where we met,

I own, to me ’s a secret yet

Life! we 've been long together
Through pleasant and through eloudy weather3
’ris hard to part when friends are dear-
Perhaps ’twill eost a sigh, a tear:
Then steal away-give little warning: “
Choose thino own time:
Say not ‘good night‚' but in some brighter olime

Bid me ‘good morning.'
