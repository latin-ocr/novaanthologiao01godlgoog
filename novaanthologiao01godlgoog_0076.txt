ANTHOLOGIA

XXXIV

All night the dreadless angel, unpursued,

Through Heaven’s wide ohampain held his way ; till
mern,

Waked by the oiroling hours, with rosy hand

Unbarred the gates of light. There is a eave

Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,

Where light and darkness in perpetual round

Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through
Heaven

Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;

Light issues forth, and at the other door

Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour

'l'o veil the heaven, though darkness there might well

Seem twilight here; and now went forth the mern,

Suoh as in highest Heaven, arrayed in gold

Empyrea13 from before her vanished night,

Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain,

Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,

Chariots, and fiaming arms, and fiery steeds‚

Refieoting blaze on blane, first met his view:

War he peroeived, war in prooinot; and found

Already known what he for news had thought

To have reported: gladly then he mixed

Among those friendly powers, who him reoeived

With joy and aoolamations loud, that one,

That of so many myriads fallen yet one

Returned not lost. On to the sacred hill

They led him high applauded‚ and present

Before tho seat supreme; from whenoe a voice,

From 'midst a golden oloud‚ thus mild was heard.
