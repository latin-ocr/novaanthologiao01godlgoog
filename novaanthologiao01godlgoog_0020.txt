4 auruoaoen

Sweeter thy voioe, but every sound is sweet;
Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,
The mean of doves in immemorial elms,

And murmuring of innumerable bees.
TENNYSON.

K. Han. Who hath sent thee now?
Mont. The constable of Franoe.
K. Hea. I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
Bid them aohieve me and then sell my bones.
Good Godl why should they mook poor follows thus?
'Phe man that onoe did sell 1116 lion's skin
While the beast liv'd, was kill'd with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves3 upon the whioh, I trust,
Shall witness live in brass ol this day’s work ;
And those that leave their valiant bones in Franoe,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,

They shall be fam'd3 for there the sun shall greet
them
And draw their honours reeking up 1ο heaven.

Let me speak proudly: tell the constable,
We are but warriors for the working-day ;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmireh’d
With rainy marching in the painful field ;
There 's not a pieoe of leather in our host-
(leod argument, I hope, we will not fly—
And time hath worn us into slovenry:

But, by the mass, our hearts 616 in the trim.
