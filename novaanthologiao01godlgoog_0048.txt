You see me here,

As one 91 you heth said, 911 old, unarm'd,
Defenoeless man3 aud yesterday you saw me
Presiding in the hall of dunel 91919,

Apparent sovereign of our hundred isles,
Robed in 91119191 purple, dealing out

The 9111919 91 o power which is not mine,
Nor yours, but of our masters-the petricians.

Why 1 was there you know, or think you know ;
Why I am tere he who 119111 been most wrong’d,

He who among you heth been most insulted,
Outruged end trodden on, until 119 doubt

11119 be worm or no, may enswer 191 me,
Asking of his own 119911 111191- brought him here?
You know my recent story, all men know it,
And judge 91 11 far differently from those

Who sate 111 judgment to heep soom on 999111.
But spere me 11191991111-11 19 here,

Here at my 119911, the outrage—but my words,
Already spent in unavuiling pleints,

Would only show my feebleness the more,

. And I come here to strengthen 91911 the strong,
And urge them on to deeds, 91111 not to war

With woman’s weapons

BYBON.
