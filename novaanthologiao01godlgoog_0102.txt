(ἑο, say Ι sent thee forth to purchase honour,
And not the king exil’d thee3 or suppose
Devouring pestilencs hangs in our air,

And thou art flying to a fresher olims.

Ι Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it

Το lie that way·th0u go’st, not whence sshou eom'st.

With how sad steps, OMoon, thou climb’st the skies,

How silenssy, and with how wan a face!

What! may it be, and even in heavenly place,

That busy Archer his sharp arrows tries?

Suro, if that long with love acquainted eyes
Can judge of love, thou feel’st a lover's ease 3
I read itin thy looks, thy languish’d grace
To me that feel the like thy state descries.
Thon even of fellowship, Ο Moon, tell me,
Is constant love desm’d sshere but want of wit?
Are beauties there as proud as here they be‘?
Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet
Those lovers seorn whom that love <ioth possess?

Do they eall virtue there ungratefulness‘?

sm PHILIP SIDNEY.
