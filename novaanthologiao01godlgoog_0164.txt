Thou ’s bean talkin’ to muther, an’ she bean a tellin'

· ΤΙιοιῘὲἸΙ not marry for munny-thou ’s sweot upo’ parson’s

N oti—azgon ’ll marry for luvv—an' we boath on us thinks

Seeii'd her todaay go& by-Saaint’sdaay-they was
ringing the belle.

She 's a beauty thou thinks-an’ sou is sooors 0’ gella,

Them as ’as munny an’ all-wot’s beauty?-the flower
as blaws.

But proputty, proputty sfinks, an' proputty, proputty
gram.

Do’ant be stunt: taake time: I knaws what makes
tha sa mad.

Warn’t Ι οωᾰκοά fur the lassos mys6n when I wura lad?

But I knaw’d a Quaflker feller as often 'as towd ma this:

‘Doiint thou marry for mmmy, but goiiwheer munny is 1’

An’ I went wheer munny war: an’ thy muther ooom

Wi' lots 0’ munny laaId by, an' a nicetish bit 0' land.

Maa'ybe she warn’t a beauty2-1 niver giv it a thowt—

But warn’t she as good bo euddle an’ kiss as alass as
'ant nowt‘?

Luvv‘? what's luvv? thou can luvv thy lass an’ 'er

Maakin' ’em goa togither as they ’ve good right to do.

Oould’n Ι luvv thy muther by cause 0' 'er munny

’ laald by?

Naffly—fur I luvv'd 'er a vast sight moor fur st&

reason why.
