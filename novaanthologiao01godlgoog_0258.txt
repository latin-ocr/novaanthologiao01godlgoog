A simil long entry lo lhe temple led,

Blind with high wells, end horror over head ;

Thence issued such a blasi, and hollow rear,

As threatened from the hinge lo heave the door.

The gale was ademanl3 eiernal lrame

Which, hewed by Mars himself, from Indian querries
came, ·

'Phe labour ofe G0d5 and all along

Tough iren plebes were clenehed io make it strong.

On lhe ether side there stood Destruehion bere3

Unpunished Rapine, and a waste of war.

Loud menaees were heard, end foul disgrace‚

And bewling infamy‚ in languege bese;

llll sense was losl in sound, and silence fied the place.
The slayer of himself yet saw I there,

'Phe gere eongealed was eletied in his heir; .

With eyes hall closed and gaping mouth he lay,

And grim, as when he breathed his sullen seul away.

DRYDEN.
