XLVIII

Gonni. ΟΞ to what purpose dost thou hoard thy
werde,
Thai thou return’st no grosfing fo thy friends?
Boliay. Ihave too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue’s office should be prodigal
Το breafhe che abundant dolour of the heart.
Gonni. Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
Boliay. J oy absent, grief is present for thar time.
Garat. What is six wintere? fhey are quickly gone.
Boline. To men in joy; bur grief makes one hour
fen. '
Gonni. Gall it a travel that thou tak’si for pleasure.
Boliay. My heart will sigh when I miscell ic so,
Which finds ic an enforced pilgrimage.
Geirei. The sullen passage of fhy weary steps
Esfeem a foil wherein fhou arf to set
The precious jewel of thy home return.
Boline. Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will bui remember me what a deal of world
I wonder from the jewels that Ι love. ¹
Muef I not serve a long apprenfioehood
To foreign passages, and in the end,
Having my freedom, boasf of nothing else
But chae Ι was a journeyman fo grief?
Gawnf. All places that 'che eye of heaven visits
Are fo a wise man poris and happy havens.
Teach thy necessity to reason thus5

There is no virtue like necessity.
Think noi the king did banish thee,

Bur thou fhe king. Woe doch the heavier sit,
Where it perceiyes ir is bui faintly borne.
