Ο Mort‚ vieux oapitaine, il est temps, levons l’ancrel
Oe pays nous ennuie, ὀ Morti Appareillonsl

si le ciel et le mer sont noirs comme de Ponere,

Nos coeurs que tu connais sont remplis de reyons!
Verso-nous ton poison, pour qu’il nous reconfortel
Nous voulons, tant ce feu nous brtle le cerveria,
Plonger au fond du gouffre‚ Enfer ou Oiel, qu’importe?

Au fond de l’Inconnu pour trouver du maceca!

We must look the possibility of failure firmly in the
face, and consider well that the Power we atteck is great
and the intelligence which guides it vigorouS, that the

contest is begun less in regard to the probability of
success than to the certainty that without it destruction
is not to be avoided, and that we do our duty better
by our own age and the next and by the honour of the
king and nation in falling with arms in our hands, than
in patiently suffering ourselves to be fettered and held
in chains. We must make ourselves familiar with the

, thought of every kind of sacrifice end of death if we

“ would tread the path now proposed. Thus prepared

internally and favoured by circumstances, let us begin in
(lod’s name and remember that by oourage and fortitude
great ends have been reached with small means. Only
we must be rid of all languid wretched creatures that are
insensible to noble feelings and incapable of any kind
of devotion and sacrifice, people who mar and spoil
everything and think of nothing but the quiet enjoymenl

of their miserable existence.
