ANTHOLOGIA

xxIV

Iton, like another’s, lies tho leurelled head:

The life that seemed a perfect song is o’er:
Oarry the last great hard to his last becl

Laud that he loved, thy noblest voice is muta
hand that he loved, that loved himl nevermore
Meadow of thino, smooth lawn or wild seashore,
Gardens of odorous bloom and tremulous fruit,
Or woodlands old, like Druid couches spread,
The master's feet shall troad.

Death's little riit hath rent the faultless luto:
The singer of undyingl songs ie dead.

Lo, in this season pensive-hued and grave,
While fades and falle the doomed, reluctant leaf
me withered Earth's fantastio coronal,

With wandering sighs of forest and of wave
llingles the murmur of a people’s grief

For him whose leaf shall fade not, neither fall
He heth fared forth, beyond these suns and showers.

For us, the autumn glow, the autumn flame,
And soon the winter silence shall be ours:
Him the eternal spring of fadeless fame

Orowns with no mortal flowers.
W. wmon.
