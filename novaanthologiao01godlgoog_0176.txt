Bul she, 'midel fear, behold his kind groy eyes,
And then, as hope oame glimmoring through her dread,
In a weak voioo ho soaroe oould hear she said:

O Dealh‚ if thou hart risen from ohe aea,
Senl bytho gods to end this miaery,
Ι thank them that thou comest in this form ;
ero rather thought lo see a hideous worm
Come trailing up the sande from out the deep,
Or suddenly owing over from tho steep
To lap me in hie folda, and bone by bone
Crush all my body: oomo then, with no moan

‚ Will I make ready now to leave the light.

But yet thy faoe ie wonderful and bright.
Art thou a god? Ah, then be kind to me.
Is there no valley far off from tho eea,
Where I may live alone, afar from atrise,
Nor angor any god with my poor life?

Or do the gods delight in misery,

And art thou come to moek me ere I dio?
W. ῙΟΒΕῙΙ.
