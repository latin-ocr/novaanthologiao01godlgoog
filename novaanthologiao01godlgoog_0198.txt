O'er the 61166111 6116111611611 green,
Where no print of step hath been,
Follow me, ae Ι sing
And touoh the warbled string,
Under the ehady roof
of brenehing elm star-proot
Follow me;
1 will bring you where 6116 sits,
01611 111 splendour as befits
Her deity.
Suoh a rural queen
All Arcadia hath 1161 seen.

Nymphs and ehepherdS, danae nemore
By eandy Ladon's lilied banks;
On old Lycaeus, or Cyllene hoar,

, 'l'rip 116 more in twilight ranks3

'Phough Erymanth your loss deploro,

Α better soil shall give ye thanke.
From the etony Maenalus
Bring your fioeke, and live with us;
Here ye shall have greater grace,
To 66116 the lady of thie plaoe.
Though Syrinx your Pan's mistress 11616,

Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.
Suoh a rural queen

All Arcadia hath not seen.
