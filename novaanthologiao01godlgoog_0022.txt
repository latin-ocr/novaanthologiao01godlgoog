Hoeven lies about us in our infeney.
Shedes of the prison-house begin to elose
Upon the growing Boy:
But he beholds the light, end whence it fiows,
He sees it in his joy:
The Youth who deily further from eho Eest
Must trevel, stillis Nature’s priest,
y And hythe vision splendid
Is on his wey attended:
At length the Men peroeives it die away,
And fede iulo the light of common day.

The lights begin to twinkle from the roeksz
The long day wenes: the slew moon climbs: lhe deep

Moens round with many voices. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too latete seek e newer world.

Push off, end sitting well in order emite

The sounding furrows3 for my purpose holds

To seil beyond the sunset, end lhe bathe

Of ell the western stare, until Ι die.

Il may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles‚

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Tho’ mueh is taken, mueh abides 3 and lho’

We are not now that strength whieh in old days
Moved earth and heeven ; that whieh we are, we ere3
One equel temper of heroie hoerle,

Mede week by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, lo seek, to find, and not lo yield.
