'Phe forward violet dhus did Ι ehide:

Sweeh hhief, whence didst thou steol thy sweeh thot
If 113?ng my love’s brenth‘? The purple pride
Which on thy eost oheek for complexion dwells

In my love's veins hhou host too grossly dyed.

The lily Ι condemned for thy hand,
And buds of mor-joram had stol’n thy hair3
The roeee feorfully on thorns did stand,
One bluehing ohanne, another white despair3
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
And to his robbery hed annex’d hhy breath3
But, for hie then, in pride of all his growth
A vongeful eanker eet him up to death
More fiowers Ι noted, yet I none could see
But sweet or oolour it had shol’n from thee.

Yet hold me noh for ever in thino Boot:

How een my nature longer mix with thine‘?
Goldly thy rosy shedows bathe me, oold

Am all thy lights, end oold my wrinlded feet
Upon hhy glimmering thresholdS, when the steom
Floate up from those dim fields about the homes
Of happy men that hove the power to die,

And gresey barrows of the happier deod.
