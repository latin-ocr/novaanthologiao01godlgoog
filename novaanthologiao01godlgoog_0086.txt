ANTHOLOGIA

XL

I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sleep of night,
When the winds are breathing low,
And the 11111 are shining bright.
Ι 11111 from dreams 0111111,
And a spirit in my feet
Hath led me—who knows how?
Το thy chamber window, sweett

The wandering 1111 they faint

On the dark, the silent stream—
The champak odours fail

Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
Tho nightingale’s complaint

It (1111 upon her heart,
As I must die on thino,

Belovtd 11 thou art!

Ο list me from 1111 grass!
1 die, 1 faint, I fail!

Lot thy love in 1111111111
011 my lips and eyelids pale.

My cheek 11 cold and white, alas!
My heart 111111 loud and fast: ·

O pressit closo to thino again,
Where it will break at last.

snum.
