o Patriot etatem, be thou wiso to know
Tho limite of resistam, and tho bounds
, Dotermining oonoeeeion3 still be bold

Not only to slight proise, but suffer soom:
And bo thy heert a fortrese, to maintain

The day against tho moment, ond the year
Agoinst the day: thy voice, a musio, heard
'Phrough all the yells and oountor·yelle of foud

And faotion3 ond thy will, a power to make

This everohanffl‘ng world of oimumstanoe
In changing, ohime with noverohanging Low. Ι

TENNYSON,

XXXVI

Peaoo to all eueht But were thero one whose fires
'Prue genius kindlee, and fair fame inspireo3

Blest with oooh tolent and oaoh ort to please,

And born to write, converso, ond live with ease:
Should euoh o man, too fond to rule alono,

Beer, like the Turi, no brother noar the throne,
View him with eoornful, yet with jealoue eyes,
And hate for arte thot caused himself to riso ;
Damn with faint moise, assent with oivil leer,
And, without sneoring, toooh the rest to sneer;
