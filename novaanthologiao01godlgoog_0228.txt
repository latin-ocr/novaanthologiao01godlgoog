rho ev’ning coel, when he, from wrath more cool,
Came, the mild judge and intercessor both,

To sentence man: the voice of eod they heard

Now walking in the garden, by 0011 winds ,

Brought 10 their ears, while day declin’d3 they heard,
And 110111 his presence hid themselves among

The thickest trees, both man and wife, till eod
Approaching thus to Adam call'd aloud.

Nor much more cause; Samson hath quit himself
Like Samson, and heroically hath finish’d

Α life heroic, on his enemies

Fully reveng'd; hath left them years of mourning,
And lamentation to the 00110 01 Caphton

Honour heth left, and freedom, let but them
Find courage to lay hold 011 this occasion;

To himself and father’s house eternal fame;

And, which 10 best and happiest yet, all this
With God not parted from him, 00 was fear’d,
But favouring and assisting to the end. ἱ
Nothing is here 101 10010, nothing to wail

Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,
Dispraise, or blame; nothing but well and 1011,

And what may quiet 110 in a death 00 noble.
