LXVIII

In vaine do men
The heavens oi their fortune's fault accuse,
Sith they know best what is the best for them:
For they to eaoh suoh fortune doe diffuse
As they doe know eaoh can most aptly use.
For not that ¹whioh men oovet most is best,
Nor that thing worst which men doe most refuse;

But fittest is that all eontented rest
With what they hold; each hath his fortune in his
breast.

Yet nottho more

Oease I to wonder where the muses haunt
Olear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,

Smit with the love of sacred song: but ohief
Theo, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath
'Phae wash thy hallow’d feet, and warbling fiow,
Nightly Ι visit: nor sometimes forget

Those other two equall'd with me in fate,

So were I equall'd with them in renown,
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides,

And Tiresias and Phineus, prophete old.

Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers ; as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling‚ and in shadiest eovert hid
Tunes her nootmnal note. Thus with the year
Seasons return3 but not to me returns

Day, 01· the sweet approach of ev’n or morn,
