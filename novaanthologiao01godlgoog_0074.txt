Το me most happy therefore he appears

who, having oneo, unmoved by hopes oriente,
Surveyed this sun, earth, ooeen, ciendo, and fleme,
Well eetisfied returns from whenee he oome.

Is life an hundred years or e'er so few,

’ris repetition all end nothing new ;

Affeir‚ where thousande meet, but none oun stuy5

An inn, where travellere buit, then post awey3

A sea, where man perpetually istest,

Now plunged in business,¹ now in trifles lost:

Who leave it first, the peaoeful port first gain;
Hold then, nor further launeh into the main3
Contraet your eeils; life nothing oen bestow

By long oontinuanoe, but ⁴continued woe:

The wretched privilege duily to deplere
The funereis of our friendS, who go before3
Dienses, peine, anxieties und suares,

And ege eurrounded with a thousand eures.
fl· smnus.
