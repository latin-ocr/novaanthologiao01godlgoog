126 ANTHOLOOEA

LXXII

She gleans 1101 silvan trophiea3 down 1110 wold
She hears 1110 sobbing 011110 stega 11111 fiee
Mixed with 1110 musio of the hunting roll’d.

But her delight is all in 11011019,

And naught of 111111 and pity wotteth she

More 111111 her hounds 11111 follow on 1110 flight3
'Phe goddess drawa a golden how 01 might,

And thick she 111110 the gentle 0111111 11111 slay.

She 100000 10000 her looks upon 1110 night,
And through 1110 dim wood Dian threads her way.

Meso. Take then 1110 worst in brief, Samson is dead.
Manna. The worst indeed; Ο 111 my hopes defeated
To free him h'enoo! but 1101111, who sets 111 1100,
Η1111 paid his ransom now and full discharge.
What windy joy this day had I conoeiv’d‚
Hopeful 01 his delivery, which now proves
Abortive as 1110 first-born bloom 01 spring
Nipt with 1110 lagging 1011 01 winter’a frostl
Yet, 0101 give 1110 10111010 grief, say first,
How died he? death 101110 is orown or shame.
All by him fell, 111011 aay’sb; by whom fell he?
What glorious hand gave Samson his death’s wound‘?
Mese. Unwounded 01 his enemies 110 1011.
Mae. Wearied with alaughter 111011, 01 how? explain.
Meas. By his own hands. ·
