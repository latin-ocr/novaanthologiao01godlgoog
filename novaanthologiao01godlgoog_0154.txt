LXXXIII

There in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,
The village master taught his little school.

A man severe he was and sternte view3

Ι knew him well and every truant knew:
Wcll had the boding tremblers learned to trace

The day’s disastcrs in his morning face;
Full well they laughed with counterlcited glee

At all his jokes-for many a joke had he;

Full well the busy whisper, circling round,
(lonveyed the dismal tidings‚ when he frowned:
Yet he was kind; or if severe in aught,

The love he bore to learning was in fault.

The village all declared how much he knew—
’Twas certain he could write and cypher too;
Lands he could measure, terma and tides presaga,
And even the story ran that he could gange.

In arguing too the parson owned his skssl,

For even though vanquished‚ he could argue still;
While words of learned length and thundering scund
Amazed the gazing rustica ranged around—

And still they gazed‚ and still the wonder grew
That one small head could cany all he knew.
