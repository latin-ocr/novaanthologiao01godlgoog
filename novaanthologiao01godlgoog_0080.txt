64 narnoroora

Willing to wound, and yet afraid to striks,
J ust hint a fault, and hesitate dislike;

Alike reserved to blame, orto commend,

A timorous foe, and a suspicious friend3
Dreading even fools‚ by flatterera besieged,
And so obliging, that he ne’er obliged;

Like Oato, give his little Senate lawa.

And sit attentive to his own applaus03
While wits and templars ey'ry sentence raiae,
And wonder with a foolish face of praise:—
Who but must laugh, if such a man there be?
Who would not weep if Atticus were he?

POPE.

He asked, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,
And silence was in Heaven: on Man’s behalf

Patron or intercessor none appeared-

Much less that durat upon his own head draw
The deadly forfaiture, and ransom set.

And now without redemption all mankind

Must have been lost, adjudged to Death and Hell
By doom severe, had nottho Son oi God,

In whom the fulneas dwells of love divine,

His decrest mediation thus renewed :-

‘Father‚ thy word is passed, Man shall find grace;
And shall Gracc not find means, that finds her way,
The speediest of thy winged messengers‚

To visit all thy creaturas, and to all

Comes unprovented, unimplored, unsoughti’
maron.
