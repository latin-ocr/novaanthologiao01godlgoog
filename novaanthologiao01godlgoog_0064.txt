Tyr. The tyrannous and bloody act is done;
The most arch deed of piteous massacre
Thai ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Porrest, whom] did subom
To do this piece of ruthlecs bulchery‚
Albeit lhey were fleah'd villania, bloody dege,
Meliing with tenderness and mild compassion,
Wept like tc children in their death’s aad story.
‘Ohl thua' quolh Dighton, ‘lay the gentle babeaz’
“Phua thua' quolh Porresl‚ ‘girdling one another
within their alabaster innocent arms:
Their lips were four red roscs on a skalk,
Which in their summer heauty kiss’d each other.

A book of prayera cn their pillow lay 3
Which once,' quoth nonest, ‘almost chang’d my mind;
But, Ο, the davil ’—thcre the villain stopp’d3

When Dighlon thus told on: ‘We smothered
The most replenished sweel work of nature,

Thai from the prime crealion e’er she fram’d.'

Hence both are gone wilh conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
To bear this lidings to the bloody king.
