Stood near it but 0 11011 on 00011 side

rhet kept the entry, and the moon was 11111.

Thon from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs3

There drew my swerd. With'sudden-flaring manes
Those two great 1100010 1000 upright like a 111011,

110011 gript 0 shoulder, and I stood between.

Ο ancient streame, 0 far-deseended woods,

Full 01 the ssuttering 01 melodious 00111ος

Ο 111110 and valleys that ¹adorn yourselves

In solemn jubilation3 winds and clouds,

000011 and land in stormy nuptials olasped,

And all exuberant creaturos that 00010111

The earth's divine renewa13 lo! I too

With yours would mingle somewhat 01 glad song;
I 100 have 001110 through wintry terrers-yea,
Through tempest and through cataclysm 01 00111
Have eome and am delivered. Me the Spring,

Me also dimly with new life hath touched

And with regenerato hope, the salt of life;

And I would dedicate these grateful 10010

ro whatsoever power beneficent—

Veiled though his oountenanoe, undivulged his thought—
Hath led me 110111 the haunted darkness forth
Into the gracious air end vernol mom,

And suffers me to know my spirit 0 note

Of this great chorus, one with bird and stream

And voieeful mountain.
