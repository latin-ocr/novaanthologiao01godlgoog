XLIV

Why do Ι love thie men? My country’e daughters

Love none but heroee But I have no country -1

The slave heth lost all, seve her bonde I love him3
And that’s the heevieet link of the long chain—

To love whom we eeteem not. Be it so:

The hour ie coming when he'll need all love,

And find none. To fell from him now were baeer
Thon to heve etebb'd him 011 hie throne when highest
Would heve been noble in my country’e creed:

I was not mede for either. Oould I eave him,

I should not love him better, but¹ myeelf3

And I have need of the last, for I have fallen

ln my own thoughts, by leving thie soft strenger.

XLV

Not from the stare do I my judgement pluck;
And yet methinks I heve astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plegues‚ of dearthe, or eeeeons’ quality;
Nor can I fortune to briei minutos tell,
Pointing to each hie thunder, rein, and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well,
By oft predict thet I in heaven find:
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derivo,
And, constant stare, in them I read such ert
As ‘Truth and beauty shall together thrIve,
If from thyself to etore thou wouldet convert ;’
Or else of thee thiel prognosticete:
‘Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom end date?
