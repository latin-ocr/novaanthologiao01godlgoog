Loitering end leapinffi

Wissh saunter, with bounde—
Fliokering end cireling

In files and in rounde—

Gaily their pinestaff green
Toeeing in eir,¹

Loose 0’er their shoulders white
Showering their hair—

See! the wild Maenade
Break from the wood‚

Youkh end Iacchus
Maddening their blood!
See! through the quiet land

Rioting they pass-

ming the fresh heaps about,
Trample the grass!

Tem· from the rified hedge
GarlendS, their prize:

Fill with their sports the field,
Fill wieh their eries!

Shepherd, what eile thee then?
Shepherd, why mute?

Forth with thy joyous song!
Forth with thy fiute!

Tempts not the revel blithe?
Lure not eheir eries?

Glow nob their shouldere smooth‘?
