From the foreste end highlands
We oome, we oome:
From the river-girh islands‚
Where loud waves are dumb
Listening to my sweet pipings.
The wind in the reeds and rushes
'Phe bees on the bells of thymo,
The birds on the myrtle bushee,
The oieale above in ohe lime,
And the lizards below in the grass,
Were as silentes ever old Tmolus was,
Listening to my sweet pipings

Liquid Peneus was flowing,
And all dark Tempe lay
In Pelion’s ehadow, outgrowing
The light of the dying day,
Speeded with my sweet pipings.
The Sileni and Silvans end Penne,
And the Nymphs of the woods and wareo,
Το the edge of the moist river-lawns,
And the brink of the dewy eoves,-
And el] that then did attend and follow,
Were silent with love: as you now, Apollo,
With envy of my eweet pipings!

1 sang of ohe danomg stare,
1 sang of the daedal Barth,

And of Hoeven, and the Giano Wsrs‚
And Love, and Death‚ and Birth:
