Ost host thou soon bolts of tho lhundor hurlod
As from thy lhreshold; day by day hast boon

A little lower than tho ohilly shoon

of ioy pinnaoles3 now, as doop profound

As these aro high, descondl Ho no’er is orownod
With immortality‚ who soors lo follow

Whoro airy voices lead: so through the hollow,

The siloni mysterios of earth descendl'
REATS.

It must bo·-

And yet it moves me, Romans! it conlounds
Tho counsols of my firm philosophy,

Thai Ruin's moroiless ploughsharo musi pass 0’or,
And barren salt bo sown on yon proud city.

As on our olivoorownod hill we stand,¹

Whero Kedron at our fool ils scanty wators
Distils from stone lo sione wilh gentle motion,
As through a valloy sacred to swoei poaoo,

How boldly doth it fronl usl how majosiioallyl
Like a luxurious vineyard, lho hill-sido

Is hung with marblo⁸ fabrico, line o’er lino,
Terraoo 0'er tarraco, nearor still, ond nearer

To tho blue heavens.
