Among the many methods which might be made use
01101 the acquiring of the virtue of contentment, I shall
only mention the two following. First 01 011, a man
should always consider how much more he has than he
wants3 and, secondly, how much more unhappy he
might be than he really is. For the first point, I am
wonderfully pleased with the reply which Aristippus
made to one who oondoled with him upon the loss 01

you have but one; so that I ought rather 10 be affiicted
101 you than you 101 1110.’ 0111110 contrary, 10011011 111011

themselves, rather than on those who 010 under greater
difficulties. All the roal pleasures and conveniences 01

mankind to be always loolring forwerd, 0111 straining
01101111οο0 who have got the start 01 them.

Α voice, he had been 11010 10 0011001000 01011ος
1101 sigh 01 his, nor plaint, ’1101 passionate moan
Had more been heard. Thus swelled it forth; ‘Descend
Young mountaineer! descend where pathways bend
,Into the rocky hollows of the world!
