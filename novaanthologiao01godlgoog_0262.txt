CLVII

Silent and moody he went, end muoh he revolved his
disoomfort;

He who was used to suooees, end to easy victories
always,

Thus to be flouted, rejected, and longhed to soorn by
a maiden,

’rhus to be mooked ond betrayed by the friend whom
most ho had trusted!

Ah! 'twas too much to be borne, ond he fretted end
ohafed in his ermour!

‘I nlone am to blome,’ he muttored, ‘for mine was
the folly.

What has a rough old soldier, grown grim end gray in
the harness,

Used to the camp and its ways, to do with the wooing
of maidens?

’rwas but a dream—let it pnes-let it venish like so
many othersl

What I thought was o flower, is only a weed, ond is
worthless!

Out of my heart will I pluok it, end throw it away,

Ι and henoeforwsrd

Be but a fighter of battles, n lover and wooer of
dengersl’

Thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat ond ·
disoomlort,

While he was morohing by day or lying at night in
the forest,

Looking up at tho trees, and the constellatione beyond
them.
