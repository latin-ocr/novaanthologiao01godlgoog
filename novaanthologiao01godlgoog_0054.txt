He looked, and saw wide territory spread

Before him, towns, and rural works between,

, Oities of men with lofty getes end towers,
Concourse in arms, fierce feces threatening war,
Giants of mighty bone end bold emprise.

Part wield their arms, part curb the foeming 'steed‚

Single, or in srray of battle renged

Both horse end foot, nor idly mustering st00d3
One wey e bend select from forege drives

A herd of heeves fair oxen end fulridus,
From a fat meedow ground, or fleecy flock,
Ewes and their bloeting lambe, over the plain,

Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,
But cell in eid, which makes c blocdy fray;

With cruel tournement the squadrons join3

Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies
With carcasses and arms the cnsanguined field,
Deserted: others to a city strong

Ley siege, encamped3 by battery, scale and mine
Assaulting: others from the well defend

With dart and jevelin, stones, and sulphureus fire;
On each hand sleughter end gigantic deeds.
