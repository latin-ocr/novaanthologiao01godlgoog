Mes chors emis, quand je mourrai,
Plantez un saule au cimetiere:

J 'aime eon feuillage eplore‚

Le peleur m’en esi douce et chere,
Ec son ombre sera legere

A la terre on je dormirai.

I found a wood with thorny boughs:
I took the thome to bind my 1110110,
I wore them likea civio crown:

I met with ocosse, Ι met with scorn's
From youth and babo and hoary heire:
They call'd me in the public equares
'Phe fool that wears a crovvn of thorno:

They oall⁷d me fool, they call'd me child:

The voice was not the voice of grief,
The words were hard to understand.
