Time wasteth yeares and months and hours:
Time doth consume fame, honour, will, and strength:
Time kills the greenest herbs and sweetest fiowors:
Time weares out youth and beautie’s lookes at length :

Time doth convey to ground both foe and friend,
And eaeh thing els but hove, whioh hath no end.

This said, he left them, and returned no more.—
But rumours hung about the country-side,
That the lost Scholar long was seen to struy‚
Seen by rure glimpses‚ pensive and tonguetiod,
In hat of antique shape, and olouk of grey,
'Phe sume the gipsies wore.
Shepherds had methim on the Hurst in spring3
At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,
On the warm ingle-benoh, the smook-froeked boors

Had found him seated at their entering.

But, mid their drink and oletter, he would fly 3-
And I myself seem half to know thy lookS,
And put the shepherdS, wanderer, on thy traoe;
And boys who iu lone wheatfields scere the rooks
1 ask if thou hast passed their quiet plaoe;
Or in my boat Ι lie
Mooled to the cool bonk in the summer beate,
Mid wide grass meadows whioh the sunehine fills,
And watoh the warm green-muffied Oumnor hius,
And wonder if thou haunt'st their shy retreats..
