CLXXVI

No forest fell
When thou wouldst build; no quarry sent ite stores
To enrieh thy walls: but thou didst hew the fioodS,
And make thy marble of the glaesy wave.
In sueh a palaee Arishaeus found
Gymne, when he bore the plaintive tale
of his lost bees te her maternal ear.

In such a paleae Poetry might place

The armoury ef winher3 where his troops,

'Phe gloomy clouds, find weepons‚ arrowy eleet‚
Skin·piereing volley‚ blossom-bruising hail.

Silently as a dream the fabric rose3

No seund ef hammer er of saw was there:

Iee upon iee, the well-adjusted parke .

Were seon eonjoined, nor ether cement asked

Thau water interfused to make them one.

Lampe graeefully disposed, and of all hueS,
Illumined every side: a wahery light

Gleamed through the clear transpareney‚ that seemed

Another moen new-risen, er meteor fallen
From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.
