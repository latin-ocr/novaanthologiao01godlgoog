ANTHOLOGIA

LXXXIV

K. Edw. Ah, Leioester‚ weigh how hardly I oen brook
To lose my orown and kingdom without oause;
To give ambitious Mortimer my right,

That like a mountain overwhelms my bliss‚

In which extremes my mind here murdered is.
But what the heavens appoint Ι must obeyt
Here, take my orown; the life of Edwerd too;
Two kings in England cannot reign at onoe.

Ι But stay ewhile, let me be king till night,
That Ι may gaze upon this glittering orowu3
So shall my eyes receive their last content,
My head, the latest honour due to it,

And jointly both yield up their wished right.
Continuo ever, thou celestial sun;

Let never silent night possess this elimo:
Stund still, you watohos of the element;

All times and seasons, rest you at a stay,
That Edward may be still fair England's king!
But dey’s bright boam doth venish fast away,
And needs I must resign my wished orown.
Inhumau creaturos! nursed with tiger’s milk!
Why gape you for your sovereign's overthrow?

My diadem I mean, aud guiltless lif .

See, monsters‚ see, I’ll wear my orown again!
unknown.
