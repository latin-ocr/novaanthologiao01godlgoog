Melt not their eyes?
Is not, on eheeks like those,

Lovely the flush? ,
-ΑῙι, so the quat was!
So was tte least!

‘So careful of the type?’ but no.
From searped eliff and quarried stone
She eries, ‘A thousand types are gone:
I aare for nothing, all shall go.

‘Thou makest thina appeal to me:
I bring te life, I bring to death:
The spirit does but mean the breath:
I know no mora’ And he, shall he,

Man, her last work, who seem’d so fair,
Sueh splendid purpose in his eyes,
Who roll'd the psalm to wintry skies,

Who built him sanes of fruitless prayer,

Who trusted God was love indeed .
And love Orestion’s final law-
Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw

With ravine, shriek’d against his areed— ,

Whe loved, who suffer’d countless ills,
who battled for the True, the Just,
Be blown about the desert dust,

Or seal'd within the iron hille?

TERNYSON.
