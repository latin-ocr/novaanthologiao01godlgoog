When in the down 1 eink my head,
Sleep, Death’s tyria-brother, times my breabh5
Sleep, Death’s twinbrolher, knows nob Deabh,
Nor ean I dream of thee ae'dead:

1 walk ae ere I walk’d forlorn,
When all our path was fresh with dew,
And all the bugle breezes blew
⁸ Reveielle 1ο lhe breaking morn.

But what is this? 1111111 about,
Ι find a trouble in bhine eye,
Whieh makes me sad I know 1101 why,

Nor ean my dream resolve the doubt:

But ere the lark habh left the lea
1 wake, and I disoern the trulh3

It is the trouble of my youth
That foolieh sleep transfere 1ο thee.
