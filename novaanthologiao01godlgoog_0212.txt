For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves
¹but not aright, Our life is short and tedious‚ and in the
death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there
any man known to have returned from the grave. For
we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter
as though we had never been: for the breath in our
nostrils is as smoke and a little spark in the moving of
our· heart: which being extinguished, our body shall be
turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the solt
air. Lot us orown ourselves with rose-buds, before they

be withered: let none of us go without his part of our

voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness

ln every place· wrsnorr or soaouor.

These hours, that with gentle work did frome

The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, ¹

Will play the tyrants to the very same

And that unfair whioh fairly doth exeel;

For never-resting time leads summer on

Το hideous winter, and eonfounds him there;

'Sap oheok'd with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,

Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:

Thon, were not summer's distillation left,

A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glasS,

Beauty's effect with beauty were horest,

Nor it, nor no remembranoe what it was:
But flowers distill’d‚ though they with winter meet,
Leese but their show3 their substance still lives sweet.
