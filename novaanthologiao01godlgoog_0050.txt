Tell me, ys studious, who pretend to see

Far into nature’s bosom, whence the beo

Was first inform’d har venturous ssight to steer
Through traohless patho and an abyss of air:

' Whenoe she avoids the slimy marsh and knows

The fertile hills, where swoeter herbage grows
And honey-mahing flowers their opening buds disolose:
How from the thieken'd mist and setting sun
Finds she the labour of her day is dono?

Who taught her against winds and rains to sitive,
To bring her burden to the certain hire,

And through the liquid fields again to pass,
Duteous and haarkaning to the sounding bross?
And, Ο thou sluggard, tell me why the ant,
'Midst summer's plenty, thinks of winter’s want,
By oonstant journeys oareful to prepare

Her stores; and bringing home the oorny ear,

By what instruction does she bite the grain,

hest, hid in earth and taking root again,

It might elude the foresight of her oare‘?

Distinet in all the inseot’s deeds appear

The marks of thought, oontrivanoe, hope and sear.

Yes‚ ’tis the eternal law that where guilt is

Sorrow shall answer it: and thou hast not
’ Α poor man’s privilege to bear alone,

Or in the narrow circle of his kinsmen,

‘Phe penalties of evil, for in thino

A nation's fate lios cirolad. King Adrastus!
