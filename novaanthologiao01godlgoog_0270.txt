ANTHOLOGIA

cnx111
het not my cold words here accuse my zeel:
'Tis not the trial of 0 woman'e war,
'I‘he bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate thie cause betwixt us twain;
The blood is hot that must be ccol'd for this:
Yet can Ι not of such tame patience boeet
As 10 be hueh’d and naught 01 011 10 say.
First, the fair reverence 01 your highnese curbe me
From giving reins and epure 10 my free speech3
Which else would post until it had return’d
These terme of treascn doubled down his throat.
Setting asido his high blood'e royalty,
And let him be no kinsman to my hege,
I do dely him, and I epit 01 him;
0011 him 0 slandercus coward and 0 villain:
Which 10 maintain Ι would allow him odda,
And meet him, were I tied 1ο run afoot
Even 10 110 frozen ridges of the Alpe,
Or any other ground inhabitable‚

Where ever Englishman duret set his foot.
Meantime let this defend my loyalty:
By 011 my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

SHAKESPEARE·
