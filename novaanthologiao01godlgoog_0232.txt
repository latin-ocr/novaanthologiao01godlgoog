But, children, al midnighl,
When eost the winde blow,
When clear falls the moonlight,
When spring-tides ar'e low;
When sweel aire come eeaward
From heathe slarred with broom,
And high rocks throw mildly
On the blanched sande a g100m;
Up th'e still, glistening heaeheS,
Up the creeks we will hie, “
Over banks of brighl seaweed
The ebhtide leaves ὼγ.
We will gaze, from the send-hille,

, At the white, sleeping town3
At the church on the hill-side-
And then come back down.
Singing: ‘There dwelle a leved one,
But cruel ie shel

She lest lonely for ever
'Phe kinge of the sea!

CXXXVIII

Unknown thou ως yet lhy fierce vaunt ie vain.

Thou dost nol slay me, proud and boaetful man.
Nol Rustum slays me, and this filia] hearl.

For were I matehed with ten such men as thou,
And I were he who till to·day I wne,

They should be lying here, Ι slending there.
