Many are the sayings of the wise,

' In antient and in modern books enroll’d,
Extolling patience as the truest fortitude;
And to the bearing well of all calamitiee‚
All chancea incident to man’s frail life,
Consolatories writ
With studied argument, and much persuasion sought,
Lenient of grief and anxious thought3
But with th² afflicted in his pange their round
Little prevails, or rather seems a tune
Horeb, and of dissonant meod from his complent,

Unless he feel within

Some source of consolation from ab0v03

Secret refreshings that repair his strength,

And sainting spirits uphold.

Ne’er drew form completer;

Yet why in my heart of hearts
Hold I Dora's eweeter‘?

Dora’s eyes of heavenly blue
Pass all painting's reach.
Ringdove's notes are discord to
The music of her speech
