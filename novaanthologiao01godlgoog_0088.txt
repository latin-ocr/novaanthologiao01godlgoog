B. The fire takes.

0. It does so,
But no fleme risos. Oease your fretful prayers,
Your whinings, and your tame petitions.
The gods love oourage armed with confidenoe,
And prayers fit to pull them down; week tears
And troubled hoarts, the dull twins of oold spirits,
They sit and smile at Hear how I salute 'em.
Divino Andate, thou who hold'st the reins
Of furious battles and disordered war,
And proudly roll'st thy swarty ohariotwheels
Over the heaps of wounds and eareases
Sailing through sees of blood; thou sure-steeled stern-

ness,

Give us this day good hearts, good eremias,
Good blows o’ both sides, wounds that tear or flight
Oan claim no share in: steel us both with angers
And warlike executions fit thy viewing;
Let Rome put on her best strength, and thy Britain,
Thy little Britain, but as great in fortune,

Meet her as strong as she, as proud, as daring!
And then look on, thou redoyed god! who does best,
Reward with honour; who despair makes fly,

Unarm for ever, and brand with infamy!
Bnhuxom* AN D mnam.
