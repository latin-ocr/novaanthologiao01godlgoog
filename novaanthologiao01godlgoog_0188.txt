Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
Nightswollen mushrooms‘? Are not our wide plains
Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
Green'd over April's lap? No howling sud

Siokens our feeriul swas, and we have had

Great bounty from Endymion our lord'
KEATS.

Orsino, noble sir,

Be pleas'd that Ι shake off these names you give me:

Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,

Though Ι confess, on base and ground enough,
Orsino's enemy. Α witohcraft drew me hither:
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
From the rude sea’s enrag’d and foamy mouth
Did Ι redeem; a wreck pust hope he was:

His life Ι gave him, and did thereto add

My love, without retention or restraint

All his in dedication; for his sake

Did I expose myself, pure for his love,

Into the danger of this adverse town3

Drew to defend him when he was beset:
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,

And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink.
