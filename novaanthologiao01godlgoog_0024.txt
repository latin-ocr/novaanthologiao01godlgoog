ANTHOLOGIA

v
Lat your shows ba new as strange,
Lea them oft and sweetly vary:

Lat them hasta so to their change
As the aaars may not tarry.

Τοο long t’ expect tha pleasing’st sight·

Doth take away from the daligha

All sour and sullen looks away,

That ara tha servants of the day:

Our sporta ara of tha humoroua Night,
Who feoda tha stara that g1ve har light,
And naeth than har wont mora bright,
Το help tha Vision of Delight.

See, see, har sceptra and her crown
Are all of flama, and from her gown
A train of light eomes waving down.
This night in dew she will not staep
Tha brain, nor look tha aenae in sleap:
But all awake with phantoms keep,
And those to make Delight more deep.

Jonson.
