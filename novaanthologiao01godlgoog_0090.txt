XLII

He searoe had said, when the bare earth, till then
Desert and bere, unsightly, unadorned,

Brought forth the tender grase, whose verdure eled
Her universal face with pleasant green3

Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered,
Opening their various colente, and made gay

Her bosom, amelling eweet; and, these soaroe blown‚ '

Forth flourished thick the elustering vine, forth crept

The ewelling gourd, up stood the oorny reed

Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,

And buah with frizzled hair implicit: last

Rosa, as in danea, the stately trees, and spread

Their brenohes hung with eopioue fruit, or gemmed

Their blossoma With high woods the hille were
erowned,

With tufts the valleys and eeoh fountain eide,

With borders long the rivers: that Earth now

Seemed like to Hoeven, a seat where Gods might
dwell,

Or wonder with delight, and love to haunt

Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained

Upon the earth, and man to till the ground

None was; but from the earth a dewy mist

Went up, end watered all the ground, and each

Plant of the field3 which, ere it was in the earth,

God made, and every herb, before it grew

On the green stem. God saw that it was good:

So even and morn recorded the third day.
