But oh, chat deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedern cover!

A savage place, as hely and enchanied

As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted

By ‘woman wailing for her demon lover.

And from this chasm, with cesseless turmeil seeffiing,
As if this earth in fast thick panis were breathing,
A mighty fountain memently was forced:

Amid whose swift, half-intermitied burst

Huge fragments vaulted like rebcunding hail,

Or chaffy grain beneath the ’chresher’s fiail;
And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever

It flung up momently the sacred river.

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Thrcugh wcod and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank intumult to a lifeless ocean:

And ’mid this {cumuli Kubla heard from far

Ancestral voices prophesying war.
