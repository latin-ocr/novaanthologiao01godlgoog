Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story!
The days of our youth arethe days of our glory;
And the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-andtwenty
Are worth all your laureis, though everso plenty.

What are garlands and orowns to the brow that is
wrinkled?
’Tis but as a dead flower with Maydew besprinkied.1

Thon away with all such from the head that is hoary!
What earo I ior the wreaths that can only give glory!

Oh Fame! ier’er took delight in thy praises,
'Twas less ior the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,
'l‘han to see the bright eyes of the dear One discover
She thought that I was not unworthy to love her.

There chiefly I sought thee, there only I found thee;
Her glanae was the best of the rays that surround thee ;
When it sparkled o’er ought that was bright in my story,

I knew it was love, and I felt it was glory.
BYROR.

Hero, when that he came not, watched all night,
Into the darkness straining hard her sight3
And morning breaking and no sign of him,
With aohing heart she scanned the sea-face dim,

Fearing to look because that lamp went out.
He was not there, but casting all about,
Lo, at the turret's foot his body lay,

Rolled on the stones, and soaked with breaking spray.

She rent her robe upon her, and leaped down
Headlong, distraoted, from the turret's orown;
There on his corpse she breathed her dying breath,

, And linked in life, those two were one in death.
