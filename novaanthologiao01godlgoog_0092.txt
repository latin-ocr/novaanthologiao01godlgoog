XLIII

Woode, that weve 0'er Delphi’s eteep,

IsleS, that erown th' Egeean deep,
Fields, that coel Ilissus leves,
Or where Maeander’s ember waves
In lingering Leb'rinths ereep,
How do your huneful Eehoes languish,
Muhe, but to the voice of Anguish‘?
Where eeeh old poetic Meuntain
Inspiretion breath’d around:
Ev'ry shade and hellow'd Fountain
Murmur'd deep a solemn sound:
Till the sad Nine, in Greeee's evil bour,
Left 'cheir Parnassus for the Letian plaine
Alike they seorn the pomp of tyrant Power‚
And eoward Vice‚ that revels in her chains.
When Latium had her lofby spirit lost,
They eoughb‚ oh Albion! next thy eea-eneircled coast.
