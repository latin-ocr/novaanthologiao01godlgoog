That same night both priest and sago
Died aooursed in sombre rage.

Never more in wild wood green

Was that glorious Goddess seen,

Never more: and from that day

Evil hap and dull deoay

Feli 011 oountryside and town:

Life and vigour dwindled down:
Storms in spring nipped bud and eprout,
Summer suns shed plague and drought,
Autumn’s store was orude and soant,
Winter snowe beleaguered want:

Vines were blaok at vintage tide,
Floeks and herde of murrain died:
Fiehing boats came empty home,

Good ships foundered in the foam:
Haggard tradere lost all heart
Wandering through the empty mart:
For the air hung thick with gloom,

Silenoe‚ and the sense of doom.
J. mouson.

LII

Never love unless you ean

Bear with all the faults of mani

Men sometimes will jealous be,

Though but little oause they see,

And hang the head as discentem,

And speak what straight they will repent.
