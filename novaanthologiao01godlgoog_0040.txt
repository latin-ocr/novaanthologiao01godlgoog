Ota. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontio sea,

Whose icy current and compulsive course

Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on

To the Propontic and the Hellespont,

Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,

Shall ne'er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,

Till that a capable and wide revenge

Swallovv them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,

In the due reverenee of a sacred vow

You elementa that clip us round about,

Witness that here Iago doth give up

'Phe execution of his vvit, hands, heart,

To wrong’d Othello’s service! Lot him command,

And to obey shall be in me remorso,

What bloody business ever.
