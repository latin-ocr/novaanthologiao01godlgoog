Who, having once, unmoved by hopes or 11111,
Surveyed 11111111, earth, ocean, clouds, end fleme,

Ι11111 en hundred years or e'er so few,

'Tis repetition all and nothing new3

A 1111, where thousands meet, but none cen stay3
An inn, where trevellers beit, then post away;
A 111, where men perpetunlly is tost,

Now plunged in business, now in 1111111 lost:
Who leave it first, the peaceful port first gein;
Hold then, nor farther launch into the main;
01111111 your seils3 1111 nothing cen bestow

The funerals of our friends, who go before;
Diseeses² pains, anxieties and snares,

And age surrounded with 1 thousand ceres.
