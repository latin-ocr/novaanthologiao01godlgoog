CXXVIII

I love, and ho loves mo again,
Yet dare I not toll who:
For if tho nymphs should vknow my swain,
I fear they'd lovo him too:
Yet if it bo not known,
Tho pleasuro is as good as nono,
For that's a narrow joy is but our own.

He io, if thoy can find him, fair,
And fresh and fragrant too,
As summoffs sky, or purgod air,
And looks as lilios do
Thai aro this morning blown:
Yet, yet· I doubt he is not known,

And foar much more, that moro of him be shown.
Jonson' .

CXXIX

Not mino own feam, nor tho prophetie soul

Of the wido world droaming on things to como,

Can yet the lonso of my true lovo control,

Suppos’d as forfeit to a confin'd doom.

Tho mortal moon hath hor eclipso ondurod,

And tho sad auguro mook their own presago ;'

Inoorfaintios now orown themselves assurod,

And poaoo prooloims olives of ondloss ago.

Now with tho drops of this most balmy fimo

My love looks fresh, and Doaih to me subsonbos,

Since, spito of him, I’ll live in this poor rimo,

While ho insulis o’er dull and spoeohloss tribes:
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,

When tyranfs' erosis and tombs of bross aro spent.
