These bad traditione of comedy effect ue not only on
the stage, but in our⁸ literature, and may be traoked into
our social life. They are the ground of the heavy¹
moralizings by which we are outwearied, about Life as

a Comedy‚ and Oomedy as a jada, when· popular writers

conscious of fatigue in oreativeness, desire to be cogent in
a modish cynicism: perversione of the idea of life, and of
the proper esteem for the society we have wrestad from
brutishness‚ and would carry higher. Stook images of
this description are accepted by the timid and sensitive,
as well as by the saturnine, quite seriously3 for not
many look abroad with their own eyes, fewer ¹still have
the habit of thinking for themselves. Life, we know too
well, is not a Comedy, but something strangely mixed;
nor is Comedy a vile mask. The corrupted importation
from France was noxious3 a noble entertainment spoilt
to suit the wretched teste of a villainous ege; and the
later imitatione of it, partly drained of its poison and
mede decorous‚ became tiresome, notwithstanding their
fun, in the perpetual recurring of the same situations,
owing to the absence of original study and vigour of

conception.
