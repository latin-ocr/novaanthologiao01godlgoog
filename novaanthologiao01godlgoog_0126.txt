Of Manners gentle, of Affections mild;
In wit, aMan3 Simplioihy, a Child:
With native Humour temp'ring virtuous Rage,

Form'd to delight ah once and lash the age:

Above Temptation, in a low Mate,
And uncorrupted‚ ev'n among the Great: '

Is mix’d with HeroeS, or with Kings thy dust;

Buh that the Worthy and the Good shall say, Ι

Striking their pensive bosoms-Here lies Gn.
POPE.
