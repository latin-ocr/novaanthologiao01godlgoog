ANTHOLOGlA

cxh

O fountains, when in you shall I
Myself, eesed of unpeaoeful thoughls, espy?
Ο fields! Owoodsl when, when shall I be made
The happy tenant of your shade‘?
Here 's the spring-head of Pleasure’s flood;
Where all the riches lie, that she

Has ooin'd and stamp’d for good.

Pride and Ambition here

Only in far-feteh'd metaphors appear:

Here nought bul winds ean hurtful murmure seatter,
And noughl bul Eeho datter.
The (leda, when they demanded, hither

From Hoeven did always ohoose their way;

And therefore we may boldly say
That ’tis the way too thither.

How happy here should I
And one deor She live and embraoing die!
She who is all the world, and ean exclude

In deserts solitudo.

Ι should have then this only sear,
hest men, when they my pleasures see,
Should all eome im’tale me,

And so make a city here.
