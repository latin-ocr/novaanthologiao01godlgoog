132 Aornoroorr

My terre, not gifts3 and like the poor, that mourn
With green but humble turfs, write o'er his heerse
For false foul prosemen thie fair truth in verse.
Horo Daphnis steros! aod while roe great walch goes
Of toort aod rootless Time, tates his reposo.

Fame o's bot ooise; ao ormino bot o thought,

Which ooo admiror, another sets ot oooqht,·

, Nature mocks boon aod wit still keeps odoe:

Bot death brings knowledge aod ossoroooo too.

Now entertnin conjecture of a time
When ereeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide veesel of the universe.
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,
The hum of either army stilly soundS,
That the fix’d sentinels almost receive
The secret whispere of each other’s watoh:
Fire answers fire, end through their paly flames
anh battle sees the other’s umber'd face:
Steed threatens steed‚ in high and boastful neighs
Pieroing the night’s dull ear3 end from the tente
The armourerS, aooomplishing the knights,

With busy hommere olosing rivets up,

Give dreadful note of preparation.
The oountry oooks do orow, the oloolrs do toll,

And the third hour of drowey morning name.
summu.
