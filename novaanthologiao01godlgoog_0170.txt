Ge i-thou ert all unfit to share
The pleasures ef thie place

With such ae its old tenentem,
Oreatures of gentler rece.

The squirrel here his heard provideS‚
Aware of wintry storme;

And woodpeekers explere the eides
Of rugged oake for worme

'Phe sheep here smoothee the knotted thorn
With frictione of her fleece ;

And here I wander eve and mern,
Like her, a friend io peaee.

Ah !-I could pity the exiled
From this secure retreat 3-

I would hot lose it io be styled
The happiest of the great

But thou canet teste no calm delighi3
Thy pleeeure is to show

Thy magnanimity in fight,
Thy prowese-therefore, goi

Ι care not whether east 01· north,
So I no more may find thee3

The angry Muse thus sings thee soah,
And cleps the gete behind thee.
