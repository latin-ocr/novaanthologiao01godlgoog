But that beloved name unnerved my arm—

That name, and something, Ι confess-in thee
Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield
Fall; and thy spear transfixed an unarmed foe.
And now thou boastest‚ and insult’st my fate.
But hear thou this, fieree man; tremble to hear!
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!

My father, whom I seek through all the world,
He shall avenge my death, and punish thee.

H. ARNOLD.

CXXXIX

A time there was, ere England’s griefs began,
When every rood of ground maintained its man.
For him light labour spread her wholesome storo,
Just gave what life required, but gave no more.
His best companions innocense and health,

And his best riehes ignoranee of wealth.

But times are altered, trade’s unfeeling train
Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain.

Along the lawn where scattered hamlets rose,
Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose;
And every want to opulenee allied,

And every pang that folly pays to pride.

Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,
These ealm desires that asked but little roem,
These healthful sports that graoed the peaeeful soene,
Lived in each look, and brightened all the green,
These far departing seek a kinder shore,

And rural mirth and manners are no more.
