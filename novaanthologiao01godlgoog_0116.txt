For some were hung with arras green and blus,
showing a geudy summer-mern,

Where with puff'd cheek the belied hunter blew
His wreathed buglehorn.

One seem'd all dark and red-s treet 01 send,
And some one pacing there alone,

Who peeed for ever in a glimmering land,
Lit with a low large moon.

One shew’d en iren coast and angry waves.
You seem’d 1ο hear them elimb and fall
And roar roek-thwarted under bellowing caves,

Beneahh the ,windy walL

And one, a full-fed river winding slow
By herds upon nn endless plain, '
The ragged rims 01 thunder brooding low,

With shadewstreaks 01 rain. ·

And one, the reapers et their sultry 1011.
In frent they bound rho shesves Behind

Were realms 01 upland, prodige] in oil,
And hosry 10 the wind.

And one a foreground blank with siones and slegs,
Beyond‚ alins 01 heighhs, and higher

All barr'd with long white cloud the seornful cragS,
And highest, snow and fire.

And one, an English home—gray twilighr pour'd
On dewy pastures, dewy trees,

Softer than sleep—nll things in order stored‚
A haunt 01 ancient Pence.

TENNYSON.
