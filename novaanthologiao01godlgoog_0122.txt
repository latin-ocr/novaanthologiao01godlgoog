LX

Never any more,
While I live,

Need Ι hope to see hie faoe
As before.

Onoe his love grown ohill,
Mine may strive:

Bitterly we reembreoe‚
Single still.

Wos it something said,
Something done,
Vexed him? was it touoh eihand,
Turn of head?
strengel that very wey
Love begun:
Ι as little understand
Love’s deoey.

When 1 sewed or drew,
I reonll ,

How he loohed os il Ι sung,
-Sweotly too.

If Ι spoke a word,
First of all

Up hie oheek the oolour sprung,
Thon he heard.

Sitting by my eide,
At my feet,
So he brenthed but air I brenthed,
Satisfied! '
Ι, too, at Love'e brim
Touohed the eweet:
I would die if death bequeothed

Sweet to him.
