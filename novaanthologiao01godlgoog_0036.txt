Thct serveth not another’s will3

Whoee armour is his honest thought,
And simple truth his utmost skill;

Nor ruin make oppressors great3

Who (lod doth late and early pray
More oi his grace than gifts to lend;
And entertains the harmless day
With 1 religione book or friend.

And, having nothing, yet heth 111.
