O! how mueh more doth beauty beauteous seem

By that eweet ornament which truth doth give!

The rose looks fair, but feirer we it deem

For that eweet odour whioh doth in it live.

The eankenbloome have full es deep a dye

As the perfumed tineture of the roseo,

Hang on such thorno, end play as wentonly

When summer's breath their masked bude diseloees:

But, for their virtue only is their show,

They live unwoo’d, and unrespeoted fade3

Die to themselves. Sweet reses do not e03

of their sweet deaths are sweetest odoure made:
And so of you, beauteous end lovely youth,
When thet shall fede, my verse distils your t1uth.

The rain had fallen, the Poet arose,
He pass'd bytho town and out of the street,
A light wind blew from the gates of the sun,
And waves of shadow went over the wheat,
And he eat him down in a lonely place,
And chanted a melody loud end sweet,
That made the wildewan pause in her cloud,
And the lerk drop down at his feet.
The ewullow stopt ee he hunted the bee,
The snake slipt under a spray,
The wild hawk stood with the down on his beak,
And stated, with his foot on the prey,

And the nightingele thought, ⁴ I have sung many songe,

But never a one so gay,
For he sings of what the world will be
When the years heve died away)
