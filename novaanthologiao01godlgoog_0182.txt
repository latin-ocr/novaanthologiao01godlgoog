ANTHOLOGIA

Life is a osty with many a street:
Doath is the market where all men meet:

If life wore a thing which gold could buy,
Tho poor could not live and tho rioh would not dio.

c
And Phaethon thoy found, or what soem’d ho,

Low lying in tho roods, a oharr’d blaok mass,
Furrow’d with tronchont firo from head to foot.
Whom yet with rovoront hands thoy Ested up
And bare him to thobank, and wash’d tho limbs
In vain3 and, for the burn'o shrods olinging to him,
Robod the oold form in raimont shining white.
Thon on tho river-margo thoy sooop'd a grave
And laid him in tho dank earth far oport,

Noar to nono olso; for so 'ohe dead are laid
Whom Zeus, tho Thundorer, hath eut off by firo.
And on tho tomb they pour’d forth wine ond oil.
Nor fail’d they to record in distich due

How from a kingly venturo kingly fall

Rosulted, and a highor than human fame.
