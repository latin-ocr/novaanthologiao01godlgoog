ANTHOLOGIA

Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,
Or hecha, or herde, or human face divine;
But cloud instead, and everduring dark
Surrounds me, from the cheefful ways of men
cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair,
Presented with a universal blank

Of Nature's werke to me expung’d and redd,

And wiedom at one entrance quite shut out.

Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion’a coast

(The storms all weathered and the ocean crost)
Shoots into port at some well-havened isle,

Where apices breathe and brighter seaeons smile3
There site quiescent on the fioods that show

Her beauteous form reflected clear below,

While aire impregnated with incense play

Around her, fanning light her streamere gay;

So thou, with ceila, how swift! hast reached the shore,
Where tempests never beat nor billcws rear,

And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide

Of life long since has anchored by thy side.

But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest,

Alwaye from port withheld, always distressed—-

Me howling blasts drive deviouS, temneat-tossed,

Sails ripped, eeams opening wide, and compaae lost,
And day by day some current's thwarting force

Sets me more dietant from a prospercue course.
-Yet‚ oh! the thought that thou art eale and he l-

That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.
