262 Awrnosoon

Smote the statue of bronze, end hurled in wrsth from
its left hand

Down on the pavement below the olettering soales of
the balanos,

And in the hollow thereos was found the nest of
smegpie,

Into whose oley-built walls the neoldaoe of pearls was

mwoven.'

Silenoed, but not convinoed, when the story was ended,
the blsoksmith

Stood likea man who fain would speak, but findeth
no languege;

All his thoughts were oongealed into lines on his faoe,
es the vapours

Freere in fantastio shepes on the window-penes in the
winter.

Money never mede any man rich, but his mind. He

’ that ean order himself to the lew of nature is not only

without the sense, but the fesr of poverty. Oh! but to
strike blind the people with our weelth and pomp, is the
thing! What a wretchedness is this, to thrust all our
riohes outward, and be beggers within; to contemplate
nothing but the little, vile, and sordid things of the
world3 not the great, noble, end precious! We serve our
sva1i003 end not content with the good of the esrth that
is offered us, we search and dig for the evil thet is hidden.
¹ God offered us those things, and placed them at hsnd
and near us, thet he knew were profitable to us; but
the hurtful he laid deep end hid. Yet do we seek only
the things whereby we may perish3 and bring them
forth, when God and nature hath buried them
