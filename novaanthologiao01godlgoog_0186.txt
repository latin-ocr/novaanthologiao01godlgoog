0111

Soon the assembly‚ 111 a circle ranged,
Stood silent round the shrine: each look was changed
To sudden veneration: women meek
Beokon’d their sons to silence; while each cheek
01 virgin bloom palad gently for slight fear.
Endymion too, without a forest poor,
Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,
Among his brothers 01 the mountain chase.
In midst 01 all, the venerable priest ’
Eyed them with joy from greatest 10 the least,
And, after lifting up his aged hands,
Thus spake he: ‘Men of Latmos! shepherd bande!
Whose care it is 10 guard a thousand flocks: ¹
Whether descended from beneath the rocks
That overtop your mountains3 whether come
From valleys where 1110 pipo is never dumb;
Or from your swelling (1011110, where sweet air stirs
Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze
Buds lavish gold; cryc, whose precious charge
Nibble their fill at ocean’s very marge,
Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds 10110111
By the dim echoes 01 old Triton’s horn:
Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare
The scrip, with needments, 101 the mountain air;
And all ye gentle girls who foster up
Udderless lamba and in a little cup
Will put choice honey for a favour'd youth :⁴
Yea, every one attend! for in good truth
Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.
