68 Anrnoioma

For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age:
But, as it were, an after-dinner’s sleep

Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Beeomes as agad, and doth beg the alms

Of palsied old: and when theu art old and rich
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riohes pleasant. What 's yet in this

That bears the name of Life? Yet in this Life
Lie hid moe thousand 11991119. Yet Death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

SHAKESPEAREq

XXXIX

No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange ;
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admira
What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
And rather make them born to our desim ,
Than think that we before have heard thern told. l
Thy registers and thee 1 both dely, ὓ ¹
Not wondering at the present 1101 the past,
For thy records and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by thy continual haste.
This I do vow, and this shall ever be;
Ι will be true, despite thy seythe and thee.
