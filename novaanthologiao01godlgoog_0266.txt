Fer. This is strange: your father’s in some passion

'Phat works him strongly.
Miro. Never till this day
Sow Ι him toueh'd with anger so distemper’d.
Pro. You do look, my son, in a moved soil,
As if you were dismay’d: be eheerful‚ sir:

Our revele now are ended. These our actore,

Ae I iorelold you, were all spirite and

Are melted into air, into thin air:

And, like the baselese fabric of this vision,
The cloud-eapp'd towers‚ the gorgeous palaees,
'Phe solemn templee, the great globo itself,
Yea, ell which it inhen't, shall dissolve

And, like this insubstantial pageanl faded,
Leeve not a raek behind. We are suoh stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life

Is rounded with a sleep.
SHAKESPEARE.
