LVI

Q. Mur. O! let me entreat thee, oense! Give me
hhy hand,
unat I may dew it with my mournful team
Nor let the rain of heaven weh thia plane,
To wash away my woeful monuments.
0! oould thie kias be printed in thy hand,
That thou mighhst think upon these hythe soal,
Through whom a thousand sighs are broahh’d for thee.
So, get hhee gone, that I may know my grief ;
’vis buh surmis’d whiles thou art standing by,
Aa one that sutfeits thinking on a wanh
Ι will repeal thee, or, be well assur’d,
Adventure to be banished myeelf3
And banished Ι am, ifbuu from thee.
Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
01 go not yet. Even thus two friends condemn’d
Embraoe and kias, and take ten thousand leaves,
Loahher a hundred times to part than die.

Yet now farewell; and farewell h'fe with thee!
Sus. Thus ie poor Suffolk ten times banished
Once by the king, and three times thrioe by thee.
’uis not the land Ι aare for, werd thou thenon,

A wilderness ie populous enough,
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:

For where thou art, there is hhe world itself,
With every several pleasure in the world,
And where thou art not, desolation.

I oan no more: live thou to joy thy life;
Myself ho joy in nought but that thou liv’st.

SHAKESPEARB.
