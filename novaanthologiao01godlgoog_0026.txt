I will not leave the smouldering pyro:
Enough remains to light again:

But who am I lo dare desire
. A place beside the king of men?

So burnl my dear Oechalian town3
And Ι an ouleasi gazed and groaned.

But, when my father’s roof fell down,
For all that wrong sweet love atoned.

He led me trembling to the ahip,

’ He seemed at last to love me then;

He seothed, he olasped me lip to lip:
How strange, to wed the king of men!

Ι linger, orphan, widow‚ slave;
Ι lived when sire and brelhren diod.

Oh, had Ι ahared my mother’e grave,
Or olomb unlo the hero's side!

That comrade old hath made his moan;
The centem oowers within hia den:

And I abida to guard alone
The ashes of the king of men.

Alone, beneath the night divine-
Alone, another weeps elsewhere:
Her love for him is unlike mine,

Her weil she will not let me share.
