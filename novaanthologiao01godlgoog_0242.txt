226 ANTHOLOGIA

Thereat was fired . . .-—no glad song

For folks to hear that wist how dire a god

Rogat this peril to them, what strong raoe
Fathered the seaborn tongue that sang them death.

Aht little think the gay lieentioue proud,
Whom pleasure‚ power, and affluenoe surround3
They, who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth
And wauton, often cruel, riot wasta 3—

Ah! little think they, while they danoe along,
How many feel this very moment death

And all the sad variety 'of pain;

How many sink in the devouring flood,

Or more devouring flame ; how many bleed
By shameful varianae betwixt man and man;
How many pine in want and dungeon gloomS,
Shut from the common air and common use
Of their own limbs; how many drink the oup
Of baleful grief or eat tho bittar bread

0f misery3 sore pieroed by wintry winda

How many shrink into the sordid hut .
Of cheorless poverty3 how many shake

With all the fieroer tortums of the mind,
Unbounded passion, madness, guilt, remorse;
How many racked with honest passions droop
In deep retired distress; how many stand
Around the death-bed of their dearest friends
And point the parting anguish!
