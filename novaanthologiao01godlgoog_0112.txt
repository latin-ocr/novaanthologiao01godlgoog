The building was a spaoious theafre

Half-round, on two main pfflars vaulted high,
With seats where all 'ohe lords, and eaoh degree
Of sori, might sitin order io behold;

The obher side was open, where the throng

On banka and soaffolds under sky might atand;
Ι among these aloof obseurely stood.

The feast and neon grew high, and sacrifice
Had fill’d their hearbs with mirth, high oheer, and wine,

When to their aporia they burn’d. Immediately
Wae Samson aa a publio servani broughb

In their state livery olad3 before him pipes

And timbrels, on each side went armed guarda,
Both horse and foot, before him and behind,
Archers and slingers, cataphracta and speara.

At sight of him ihe people with a shout

Rifred the air, olamouring their god with praisa
Who had made their dreadful enemy their thralh
He, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,

· Came io the place3 and what was sei before him,
’ which without help or eye might ee assaya

To heare, pull, draw, or break, he still perform'd
All with incredible, stupendious forae,

Nono daring to appear antagonist.

Ι rumor.
