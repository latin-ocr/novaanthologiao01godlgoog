36 Arrfloioom

Mailed as thy heart is with the usages

Of pomp and power, a few short summers since
Thou wert a child, and oanst not be relentless.

0! if maternal love embraced thoe then

Think of the mothers who with eyes uniret

Glare o’er their perishing children. Hast thou shared
The glow of a first friendship, whioh is born

’Midst the rude sports oi boyhood, think of youth
Smitten amidst its playthings—let the spirit

0f thine own innocent ohildhood whisper pity.

0 snatohed away in beauty's bloom‚

On thee shall prees no ponderous tomb,
But on thy turf shall roses rear
Their leaves, the earliest of the year,
And the wild cypress wave in tendor gloom. ,

And oft by yon blue gushing stream
Shall Somow lean her drooping head,

And foed deep thought with many a dream;
And lingering pause and lightly tread,

Fond wretohl as if her step disturbed thedoad!

Away! we know that tears are vain,

That Death nor heeds nor hears distress ;
Will this unteaoh us to complain,

Or make one mourner weep the less?
And thou, who tell’st me to forget,

Thy looks are wan, thino eyes are wet
BYBON.
