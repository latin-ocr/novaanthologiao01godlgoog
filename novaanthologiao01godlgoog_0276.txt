This was the old mcn’s favouritc tale, and 116 loved to
tepeat it
When his neighbours complained that any injustius

was done them.

‘Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer
remember,

Raised alost on a column, a brazen statue of J ustice

Stood in the public square, upholding the scales inite
left hand,

And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice
presided

Over the lawe of the land, and the heatts and homes
of the people.

Even the birds had built their ueste in the scales of
the balance,

Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sun·
shine above them.

But in the course of time the laws of the land were
corrupted;

Might took the place of right, and the weak were
oppressed, and the mighty

Rulsd with an iron rod. Thou it ohanoed in a noble
man’s palace

That aneoklaoe of pearls was lost, and ere long a
suspicion

Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the housohold.

she, aiter fonn of tiial condemned to dis cn the
scaffold‚

Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue cf
Juetice.

As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,

Lol o'er the city a tempest rosc; and the bolts of the
thunder
