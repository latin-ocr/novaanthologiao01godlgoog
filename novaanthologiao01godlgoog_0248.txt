CXLVII

Better to weit:
The wise men wait3 it is the foolish haste,
And ere the scenos ere in the elides would play,

And while the instrumente are lunIng, dance.

I seo Napoleon on the heighls intent

To ernest that one brief unit of loose lime

Which hands high Victory’s thread3 his marshals fret,
Hie soldiers clamour low: the very guns

Seem going off themselves3 the cannon strein

Like hell-dogs in the leeeh. But he, he weits3

And leesor chaneos and inferior hopes

Meenlime go pouring past.

CXLVIII

Drink lo me only with thlne eyeS,
And I will pledge with mine;

Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
And I'll not look for wine.

The thirst that from tho soul dolh riso
Doth ask e drink divine:

But might I of Jove’s nector sup,
I would not change for thino.
