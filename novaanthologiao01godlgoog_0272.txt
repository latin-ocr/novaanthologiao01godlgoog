But wherofors do not you a mightier way
Mako war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
And fortify yoursolf in your deeoy
With means mors blossod than my barren rime?
Now stand you on ’ohe top of happy hours,
And many maidsn gardsns yet umet,
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowsrs
Muoh likor than your painted oountsrfsib:
So should tho linos of life thau life repair,
Which this, Timo’s penul, or my pupil pen,
Noither in inward worth nor outward fuir,
Gan msko you live yoursolf in eyes of men.

To give away yoursolf keeps yourself still3

And you must live, drawn by your own sweot skr'll.

CLXV

Woary with toil, I haste me to my bod,

Tho dsar reposo for limbs with travol tired3

But then begins a journey in my head

Το work my mind, when body’s work ’s expir’d:

For then my thoughts-from far where I abido-—

Intend a zealous pilgrimage to theo,

And keep my drooping ‚eyelids open wide,

Looking on darkness whioh the blind do seo:

Savo that my soul's imaginsry sight

Presonts thy shadow to my sightless view

Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,

Makes blaok night bsauheous and hor old face new.
Lo! thus, by dsy my limbs‚ by night my mind,
For thee and for mysslf no quiet find.

mmmm.
