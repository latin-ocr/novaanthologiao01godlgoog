CXLVI

[Should all our ehurehmen foam in spite
At you, so oareful of the right,

Yet one lay-hearth would give you weloome]
(Tale it and come) to the Isle of Wight3

Where, far from noise and smoke of town,
I watoh the twilighr falling brown

All round a oareless-order'd garden
Olose to the ridge of a noble down.

You’ll have no soandal while you dine,
But honest talk and wholesome wine,
And only hear the magpie gossip

Garrulous under a roof of pino:

For groves of plne on either hand,

To break the blasl of winter, stand ;
And further on, the hoary Channel
rumbles a billow on ohalk and sand;

Where, if below the mllky sheep
Some ship of battle slowly ereep,

And on thro' zones of light and shadow
Glimmer away to the lonely deep,

We might disouss the Northern sin

Whioh made a selfish war begin3
[Dispute the olaims, arrange the ohanoes;

Emperor, Olloman, whioh shall win] mm
