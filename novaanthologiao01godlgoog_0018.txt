Oome down, 0 Maid, from yonder mountain height:
What pleasure lives in height? (the shepherd sang)
In height and oold, the splendour 01 the hius?
But 00000 to move so near the bearem, and 00000
To glido a sunbeam by the blasted pine,
To 011 0 0101 upon the sparkling spire:
And come, for Leve 10 011110 valley, eome,
For hove 10 01 the valley, oome thou down
And find him ; hythe happy threehold he,
Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,
Or red with spirted purple 01 thorota,
Or foxlike in the vine; nor 00100 10 walk
With Death and Moming on the silver horne:
Nor wilt thou 011010 him in 1110 white ravine,
Nor find him dropped upon tho 1111110 01100,
Thai huddling elant in furrow-oloven 10110
Το 1011 the torrent out 01 dusky doore:
But follow: 101 the torrent (101100 thee down
'ro find him in the valley: let the wild
Lean-headed eagles yelp alone, and leave
The monstrous ledges there to slope and spill
Their thousand wreathes of dangling water-emole,
'l'hat like a broken purpose waste in air:
So waste not thou: but eome; 101011 tho vale
Awaits thee: azure pillars 01 the hearth
Ariee to thee: and children eall, and I
Thy shepherd pipo, and eweet 10 every sound:
