CLXXII

He was my friend, ’ohe truest friend on eerth3
A strong and mighty influenoe join'd our birth3
Nor did we envy the most sounding name

By friendship giv'n of old to fame.

None but his brothton he, end sistere knew,
Whom the kind youth preferr’d to me;
And ev'n in that we did agree,

For much above myeelf Ι lov'd them too.

Say, for you saw ns, ye immortal lighte‚

How oft unwearied have we spent the nighie?

Til] the Ledaean stare, eo fam'd for love,
Wondered ot us from above.

We spent them not in toyS, in iuste, or wine3
But search of deep philosophy,
wit, eloquenoe, andpoet1y‚

Ans which I lov'd, for they, my friend, were thino.

CLXXIII

Under ’ohe wide and etarry sky

Dig the greve end lei me lie;

Glad did I live and gladly die,
And I laid me down with a will.

Thisbe the verse you grave for me:
‘Here he lies where he longed to be ;

Home is the eailor, home from see,
And the hunter home from the hill.'
