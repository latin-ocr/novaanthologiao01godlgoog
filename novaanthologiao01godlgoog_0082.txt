Reason thus with Life:

If I do lose thee, I do lose e thing

Thac none bul fools would keep: abreeth thou arl, ’
Servile to all the skyey infraenes,

Thai do this habite-tion, where thou keep'st‚

Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art Death's fool ;

For him lhou labour’st by thy flight to shun,

And yet run’st toward him still. 'I'hou art not noble:
For all the accommodatione that thou bear'sl

Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant:

For thou dost fear· lhe soft end tendor fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is deep,

And that thou 0st provok'st: yet grossly feor'st

Thy death, which is no more. Thou 'rt not thyeelf:
For thou exist'el on many a thousand grains

Thai issue out of duel. Happy thou art not:

For whel thou hest nol, still lhou etriv’st lo get,
And whal thou hesi, forgel’st. Thou art nol certain:
For thy complexion shiste to strange effecte,

After the moon. If thou ert rich, thou 'rt poor:
For, like an ass whose back wilh ingots bewe,

[hou bearet thy heavy riches but a journey,

And Death unloads thee. Friend hest thou none;
For thino own bowels, which do cell thee sire,

'l'he mere effusion of thy proper loine,

Do curse the gout, scrpigo, and the rheun1‚
