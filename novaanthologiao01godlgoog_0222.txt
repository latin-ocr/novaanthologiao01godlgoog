CXXXI

what needs complainte
When she a pleee
Hes with the raoe
Of saints?
In endless mirth
She thinks not on
What's said or done
In earth.

She sees n0 teate,
Nor any tone
01 thy deep grean 1

She hears:
Nor does she mind,

Or think 011 ’t now, ,
That ever thou

Waet kind3
But, changed above,
She likes not there,
As she did here,

Thy love.
Forbear‚ therefore,
And lull asleep
Thy woes‚ and weep

No mom.
