In 111 my wenderings round this world of care, Ι

11 all my griefs-and God has given my share—
Ι etill had hopes, my latest hours to crown,
Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;
To husband out life’s taper 11 the close,

And keep the 116116 from wasting by repose.

I still had hopes, for pride attende us still,
Amidet the swains to show my book-learn'd skill,
Around my fire 11 evening group to draw,

And tell of 111 I felt, and 111 I saw3

And, ae the hare, whom hounds and horne pursue,
Pente to the place from whence 61 first she flew,
I still had hopes, my long vexatione pass’d

Here to return-and die ethome 611611.

Ο blest retirement, friend to life's decline,
Retreate from care, 11111 16161 must be mine,
How happy he who 6161116 in shadee like these
A youth of labour with 11 age of eaee;

Who quite 6 world where strong temptatione try,

And, since ’tis hard to combat, learns to flyi

For him no wretchee, born to work and weep,

Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep3

No eurly porter stands in guilty etate

To epurn imploring famine from the gate3 ’

But on he moves to meet hie latter end,

Angele around befriending Virtue's friend3

Bends to the grave with unperceiv’d decey,

While Resignction gently elopee the way3

And, 111 hie prospecte brightening to 11161111,

His Hoeven commences ere the world be paes’d!
