OLV

Sleep, angry beauty‚ sleep and fear not me:

For who a sleeping lion dares provoke?

It shall suffice me here to sit and see

These lips shut up, that never kindly spoke:
What sight can more content a lover’s mind

'than beauty seeming harmless‚ if not kind?

My words haye charm'd her, for secure she sleeps,¹

Though guilty much of wrong done to my love:
And in her slumbor, see! she closeeyed weeps!
Dreams often more than waking passione move.
Plead‚ sleop‚ my cause, and make her aoft like thee,

That she in peace may wake and pity mo!

CLVI

He scarce had finish'd, when such murmur fill’d
rh’ assembly, as when hollow rocks retain
The sound of blust’ring winde, which all night long
Had rous’d the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
Soa-faring men o’er·watch’d‚ whose bark by chance
Or pinnace anchore in a craggy bay
After the tempest: such appianae was heard
Aa Mammon ended, and his sentence pleas’d,
Adrising peace: for such another field
They dreaded worse than Hell: so much the sear
Of thunder and the sword of Michael
Wrought still within them, and no less desire
To found this nether empne, which might rise
By policy‚ and long process of time,

111 emulation oppositate Heav'n.
