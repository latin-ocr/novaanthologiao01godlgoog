And nigh’a earne down over 1110 solemn waste
And the two garing 110010 and 1111110010 pair
And darkened all, and a eold sog with night
Orept from the 011110. Soon a hum arose
Aa 01 a great assembly loosed, and fires
Began 10 1111111110 through the seg, for now
Both armies moved 1ο camp and 1001111011 mea13
The Persians 10011 it 011 the open sanda
Seuthward: 1110 Tartara by 1110 river marga,
And Rusturrr and 11100011 were left alone.

Bur the majeaiie river floated 011
0111011110 mist and hum 01 that low land
11110 the froaky ataugia, and there moved
Rejoieing through 1110 huahed Chorasmian waste
-Under the aoliiary 1110011. Ηο flowed
Right for 1110 polar star past Orgunje
Brimming and brighi and large. Then sanda begin
To hem hia watery march, and dam his streame,
And split his currente, 11101101 many a league
The ahorn and parcelled Oxus 01101110 along
Through beda of saud and maited rushy isles,
Oxus forgetiing 1110 bright speed he had
In his high mountain eradle in Pamire‚
A foiled circuitous wanderer; 1111 ai 1001

The longed·f0r dash of waves is heard, and wide
His luminous home of wetere opens brighi
And tranquil, from whose 110011110 new-bathed stars

Emerge and shine upon the Aral sea.
