When winds thet move not its calm surfaoe sweep

The azure sea, Ι love the land nemore:
The smiles ottho serene and tranquil deep

- Tempt my unquiet mind—But whe‘n the roar ’
0f ocean’s grey abyss resounds, end feam
Gathers upon the ses, end vast waves burst,
Ι turn from the dreer sspeot to the home
0f earth and its deep woods, where, interspersed,
When winds blow loud, pines melre sweet melody3
Whose house is some lone berh, whose toil the sea,
Whose prey the wondering fish, an evil lot

Has ‹hosen-But ,Ι my languid limbs will fling

Beneeth the plene, where the brook’s murmuring

Mores the calm spirit but disturbs it not.

From feirest oreatures we desire increase,
Thet thereby beauty’s rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time deoease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contraoted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light’s fleme with seli-substantisl fuel,
Making a femine where abundenoe lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou thet art now the world’s fresh ornament
And only herald to the geudy spring, ἵ
Within thino own bud buriest thy content
And, tendor ohurl, mak'st waste in niggarding.

Pity the world, or else this glutton be,

To eet the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
