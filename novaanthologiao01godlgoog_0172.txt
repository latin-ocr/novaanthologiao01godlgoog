xc11

Oh Friendship, eordial of the human breast!
So little felt, so fervently professedl

Thy blossoms deok our unsuspeoting years3
rho promise of delicious fruit appears:

But soon, alas, we find the rash mistake
That sanguine inexperienoe loves to make,
And view with tears the expected harvest lost,
Deoayed by time or withered by a frost.
Whoever undertakes a friend's great part

¹ Should be renewed in nature, pure in heart,
Prepared for martyrdom, and strong to prove
A thousand ways the foroe of genuine love.
He may be ealled to give up health and gain,
To exchange content for trouble, ease for pain,

To echo sigh for sigh, and groan for grean,

And wet his oheeks with sorrows nothis own.
The heart elman, for suoh a taak too frail,
When most relied on, is most sure to fail;
And, summoned to partake its fellow's woe,
Starts from its office, like a broken bow.

GOWPEB.

Hruu ro Iunas

God of the varied bow,

aod of the thousand eyes,

From all the winds that blow,
Thy praises risa.
