ANTHOLOGIA

‘Speak, I love thee besti’
He exolaimed:
‘Iret thy love my own foretoll,'

I confessed:

‘Olasp my heart 011 thino
Now unblamed

Sinos upon thy soul as well
Hangeth minol'

Was it wrong to own,
Being nuth?
Why should all the giving prove
His alone?
I had wealih and ease,
Beauiy, youih:
Sinos my lover gave me love
1 gave thaso.

Thai was all I meant,
-Το be just,

And the passion I had raised
To content.

Sinos he chose to ohange
Gold for dust,

If I gave him whai ho praised
Was it strange?

Would he loved me yet,
On and on,

While Ι found some way undreamed‚
-Paid my debt!
Gara more life and more,

'PilL all gone,
He should smila ‘She never seemed

Mine before.
