Manuel, Ι (10 not shed a tear
Our parting lo delay;

Ι dare not lislen to my sear,
Ι dare nol bid thee stay.

The herm may shrink, the spirit fail, ·
But Spaniards must be free!

And pride and duty shall prevail
O’er all my love for thee.

Then ge, and round that gallanl head,
Like bennam in the air,

Shall fleat full many a daring hope
And many a lender prayer.

Should freedom perish-at thy death
’Twere madness to repine ;

And I should every feeling lose
Except the wish for mine.

But if {hx} destiny of Spain

Be once ¹gain toriae!
Ο grant MSYW! to read the lale

In Manuel's '0yful eyes·
