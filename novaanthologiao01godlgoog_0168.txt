Ο lady, leave thy silken thread
And fiowery tapestrie3
There 's living rosea on the bush,

And bloeeome en the treet

Stoop where thou wilt, thy careless hand
Some random bud will meet3

Thou eanst not troad, but thou wilt find
'Phe daisy at thy feet.

’Tis like the birthday of the world,
When earth was born in bloom;

The light ie made oi many dyee,
The airis all perfume;

There ’s erimson bude, and white and blue-
The very rainbovv shewers

Have turn’d to bleesome where they fell, Ι
And sovvn the earth with flovvera

There ’s fairy tulips in the east,
The garden of the eun3

vhe very streame refiert the hues,
And blossoms aa they run:

While Morn opes like a erimson rose,
Stil] wel with pearly ehovvers;

Ther, lady, leave the eilken thread

Thou tvvineet into flowerel
