Oh.
llyGod! CunithepoffilhleIheve
To die so suddenly? so young to go
Under the obscure, oold, rotting, wormy ground?
Το be miled down intou nurrowpleoe;
To see no more swoet sunshine; hear no mom
Blitho voioe of living thiug; muse not again
Upon familiar thoughts—sud, yet thus lost!
How feerlul! To be nothing! or to be·-
what? Or where um 1? laet me netgo mod!
Sweet Heeven, forgive weak thoughts ! If there should he
No God, no heaven, no earth, in the void world,
The wide, grey, lumplese, deep, unpeopled world!
If all things then should be my father's spirit,
His eye, his voioe, his touch, surrounding me,
The atmosphere and breeth of my deod life!
If sometimes, as a shepe more like himself,
Even the form which tortured me on earth,
Mesked in grey heire end wrinkles, he should come,
Andwindmeinhishellisherms, endfix

' His eyes on mine, and dmg me down, down, down!

For was he not alone omnipoteni

On earth, and ever present? Even though deod
Does nothis spirit live in all that breethe,
And work for me end mine still the same ruin,

Seorn, pain, despair?
sumu.
