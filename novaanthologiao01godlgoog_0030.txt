When the man wants weight the woman takes it up,
And topplos down tho scales3 but this ie fixed

Aa are the roote of emh and baso of all:

Man for the field and woman for the hearth:

Man for tho swerd and for the needle she:

Man with the head, and woman with the beart:
Man to command and woman to obey:

All else confusion. Look you! the gray maro

Is ill to live with, when her whinny shrills

From tile oo soullery, and her small goodman
Shrinks in his arm-ohair while the fires of Hell

Mix with his hearth: but you-she’s yet a colt—
Take‚ break her: strongly groom’d and etraitly ourb’d
She might not rank with those detestablo

That let the bantling soald at home, and brawl

Their rights or wrongs like pot-herba in the ¹street.
