CXVI

Οὐράνιον μίμημα γενεθλιακαῖσιν ἓν ὥραις

τοῦτ’ ἀπὸ Νειλογενοῦς δέξο Λεωνῶεω,
Ποππαία, Διὸς εὖνι, Σεβαστιάς· εὔαδε γάρ σοι

δῶρα τὰ καὶ λέκτρων ἄξια καὶ σοφίης.

GREEK Anruomor.

Not him I pratee, who from the world retineo,
By no en11vening generous passion fired,

On flowery couches elumbers life away

And gently bids his active powers decay ;

Who fears bright glory's awful face to see,
And shuns renown es muoh as infamyt

But blest is he, who, exereised in cares,

To private leisure publio virtue bears;

Who. tranquil ends the raoe he nobly run,

And deeks reposo with trophies lebour won.
Him honour follows to the secret shede,

And orowns propitious his deelining heed;

In his retreat their harpe the Muses string,
For him in lays unbought spontaneous sing3
Friendehip and truth on all his momente weit,
Pleesed with retirement better than with stam
And round the bower where humbly great he lies

Fair olives bloom, or verdant laurels riso.
rrrrrrror.
