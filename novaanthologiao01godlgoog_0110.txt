Ghild, when thou wert gone,
I envied human wives, end nested birds,
Yee‚ the oubb'd lieness ; went in search of thee
Thro’ many e paleae, many a cot, end gave
Thy breest to eiling infenks in the night,
And set the mother waking in emaze
To find her siek one whole ; and forth again
Among the weil of midnighss winde, and eried‚
‘Where is my loved one? Wherefore do ye weil?'
And out from all the night en anewer ehrill'd,

‘We know not, and we know noss why we waik'

I olimb'd on all the eliffs of all the sees,

And aek’d the wavos that moen about the world
‘Where‘? do ye make your meaning for my childr’
And round from all the world the voiees eeme
‘We know not, and we know not why we moen’
‘Where'? and I stered from every engle-peak,

I thridded the blaek heart of all the woodo,

I peer’d thro’ tomb and eave, end in eho storms

Of Aukumn swept across eho oiky, end heard

The murmur of their temples chanting me,

Me, me, the desolate Mother! ‘Where ⁹?-end tum'd,
And fied by many a waste, forlom of men,

And grieved forman thro' all my grief for thee,—
The jungle rooted in his shattor'd hearth,

'Phe serpent coil’d about his broken abest,

The scorpion orawling over neked skulls ;—

I saw the tiger in the ruin’d fene

Spring from his fallen God, but traco of thee

I saw not.
