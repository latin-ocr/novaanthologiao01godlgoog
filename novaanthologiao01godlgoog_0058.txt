And Ι will lay thoe in that lovoly earth,

And haap a statsly mound above thy bonas,

And plant a far-seon pillar over all,

And men shall not forgot thee in thy grava.

And I will spara thy host; yea, lat tham go!

Lot them all oross tha Oxus back in psaosl

What should I do with slaying any mora?

For would that all whom I have erar slain

Might bo onos more alive3 my bitterost foas,

And thoy who ware oall’d champions in thsir time,
And through whose daath 1 won that famo 1 have,
And I wera nothing but a common man,

Α poor, mean soldier, and without renown3

So thou mightsst lius too, my son, my son!

Or rather would that I, oven I mysolf,

Might now bo lying on this bloody sand,

Naar daath, and by an ignorant stroke of thino,
Not thou of mins; and I might dia, not thou;
And Ι, not thou, bs borno to' Seistan ; ι
And Zal might weap above my grava, not thin0;
And say: ‘O son, 1 waap thoe not too sore,

For willingly, Ι know, thou mot’st thina end l’
But now in blood and battlos was my youth,

And full of blood and battlos is my age,

And I shall novor ond this life of blood.
