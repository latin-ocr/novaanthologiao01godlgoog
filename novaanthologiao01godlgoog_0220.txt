CXXX

Cor. Come leave your tears: a brief farewell: the
beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient eourage? you were us'd
To say extremity was the trior of spirits ;
That common chauces common men could bear;
Thac when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating3 fortune’s blows,
When most struck home, being gentle, wounded‚ aravos
A noble cunning: you were us’d to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that oonn’d them.
Vir. Ο heavens! 0 heavensl
Gor. Nay, Ι prithee, woman,—
Vol. Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupatione perish!
Cor. What, what, what!

I shall be lov’d when I am lack’d. Nay, mother,
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Herculea,

“ Six of his labours you 'd have done, and sav’d
Your husband so much sweat.

SHAKESPEARE.
