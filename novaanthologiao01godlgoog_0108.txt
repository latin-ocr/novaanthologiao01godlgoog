ANTHOLOGIA

Meu that but one Saint adore,

Maka a show of love to more;

Beauty must be soorned in none,
Though but truly served in one:

For what is eourtship but disguise?
True hearts may have dissembling eyes.

Men, when their affairs require,
Must awhile themselves retire:

Sometimes hunt and sometimes hawk,
And not ever sit and talk:

Il these and such-like you can bear,

Then like and love, and never sear!

LIII

The world is too much with us; late aud soon
Gotting and spending, we lay waste our powers;
Little we see in Nature that is ours:
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
The sea that bures her bosom to the moon,
The winde that will be howling at all hours
And are upgathered now like sleeping flowers-
For this, for everything‚ we are out of tune:
It moves us not, Great Godl I’d rather be
A Pagan, suckled in a oreed outworn:
So might Ι, standing on this pleasant lea,
Have glimpses that would melre me less forlorn,
Have eight ol Proteus rising from the sea,

Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn!
